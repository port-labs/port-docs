# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

A software catalog keeps track of all your cloud and development resources and assets. Moreover, it gives your developers a full picture of your development infrastructure and responsibilities for different services.

:::tip
You can read more about software catalogs on our [blog](https://www.getport.io/blog/microservice-catalog-isnt-enough-why-software-catalogs-with-resources-inside-are-the-right-approach-for-developer-portal)
:::

## Goal

In this guide, you will setup an initial software catalog. You will learn how to use:

- Port's [Terraform provider](../build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/iac/terraform/terraform.md) - to create your cloud resources;
- Port's [REST API](../api-reference/api-reference.mdx) - to create your deployment configs;
- Port's [GitHub Action](../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/ci-cd/github-workflow/github-workflow.md) - to create your service deployments.
- Port's [GitHub App](../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/gitops/github-app-gitops/github-app-gitops.md) - to create your services;
- Port's [Kubernetes Exporter](../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/kubernetes/kubernetes.md) - to create your deployment service pods;

By the end of this guide, you will have a _Basic Model_ of a software catalog.

The Basic Model covers the main SDLC intersections: from Services, to Environments and Deployments, and lastly the cloud:

![software catalog layout](../../static/img/complete-use-cases/software-catalog/software-catalog-layout.png)

Before we dive into the details of each [Blueprint](../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md) type in the software catalog, here’s a brief explanation of the ontology diagrammed below, and how will we create [Entities](../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog.md#entity-json-structure) for each of them:

- **Service** - a microservice, a software monolith, or any other software architecture.
  - In this example services will be reported by Port's GitHub App.
- **Environment** - any production, staging, QA, DevEnv, on-demand, or any other environment type.
  - In this example environments will be reported using Port's Terraform Provider.
- **Deployment Config** - a representation of the current “live” version of a service running in a specific environment. It will include references to the service, environment, and deployment, as well as real-time information such as status, uptime, and any other relevant metadata.
  - In this example deployment configs will be reported manually.
- **Deployed Service Pod** - pods (instances) of a service. It includes a reference to the deployment config and details such as the specification and runtime status of containers.
  - In this example deployment service pods will be reported using Port's Kubernetes Exporter.
- **Deployment** - an object representing a CD job. It includes the version of the deployed service and a link to the job itself. Unlike other objects, the deployment is an immutable item in the software catalog. It is important to keep it immutable to ensure the catalog remains reliable.
  - In this example deployments will be reported using Port's GitHub Action as part of the deployment process.

Now that you know the end result of this guide, let's start by creating the Blueprints and [Relations](../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/relate-blueprints/relate-blueprints.md) of your software catalog.

## Blueprints and Relations

Below you can find the JSON for all the Blueprints you require in the following guide:

:::note
The Blueprint JSON provided below already includes the Relations between the different Blueprints, so please create them in the order that they appear.

</details>

Now that you have your Blueprints created, connected and ready to go, time to create your Entities:

## Entities

### Environment - Terraform provider

To keep things short and simple, let's assume you only have a production environment. We'll use Port's [Terraform provider](../build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/iac/terraform/terraform.md) to create an Entity for it.

:::info
In a real environment, this terraform file would also include actual provisioning of cloud resources, such as the kubernetes namespace corresponding to the environment Entity.
:::

Create a file called `env.tf` with the following content:

```hcl showLineNumbers
terraform {
  required_providers {
    port = {
      source  = "port-labs/port-labs"
      version = "~> 0.8.3"
    }
  }
}

provider "port" {
  client_id = "{YOUR CLIENT ID}"     # or set the env var PORT_CLIENT_ID
  secret    = "{YOUR CLIENT SECRET}" # or set the env var PORT_CLIENT_SECRET
}

resource "port_entity" "production" {
  identifier = "production"
  title      = "Production"
  blueprint  = "environment"
  properties {
    name  = "awsRegion"
    value = "eu-west-1"
  }
  properties {
    name  = "configUrl"
    value = "https://github.com/config-labs/kube/config.yml"
  }
  properties {
    name  = "slackChannel"
    value = "https://yourslack.slack.com/archives/CHANNEL-ID"
  }
  properties {
    name  = "onCall"
    value = "Mor P"
  }
  properties {
    name  = "namespace"
    value = "Production"
  }
}
```

:::note
Remember to replace the placeholders for `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with your Port client ID and secret.
:::

Now, in the same directory as the one you created `env.tf`, run the following commands:

```bash showLineNumbers
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Now that you have your environment ready, it's time to create a service.

### Service - GitHub app

To create your service, you will connect Port's [GitHub app](../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/gitops/github-app-gitops/github-app-gitops.md) to your service repository, and add a `port.yml` file describing the service you want to create an Entity for in Port.

Here is an example `port.yml` file for a service called `Notification Service`:

```yml showLineNumbers
identifier: notification-service
title: Notification Service
blueprint: service
properties:
  slackChannel: "https://yourslack.slack.com/archives/CHANNEL-ID"
  onCall: "Mor P"
  coreLanguage: "Python"
  businessDomain: "Infra"
  docsLink: "https://docs.exmaple.com"
  deploymentService: "Lambda"
  helmLink: "https://github.com/port-labs/helm/notification.yml"
```

:::info
Before, you created a Relation from the service Blueprint to itself. That Relation allowed you to map dependencies between your services. If you want to add a service on which `notification-service` depends, add the following `relations` key to the `port.yml` (notice some services were added as an example):

```yml showLineNumbers
relations:
  service:
    - authorization-service
    - authentication-service
    - mailer-service
```

:::

:::tip
`repo` is a GitHub App [auto-imported properties](../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/gitops/github-app-gitops/auto-importing-properties.md), as such it will be added automatically to the `port.yml` file of the service Entity.
:::

After the commit of the `port.yml` file to your repository, you will now see your service in Port.

### Deployment Config - Port API {#deployment-config-bp}

A deployment config is used to represent a service deployment in a specific environment in your infrastructure. A deployment config has multiple `deployments` tied to it, each representing a new version of the deployed code of the matching service, in its matching environment.

A deployment config is also just what it sounds like - a `config`, which means it is a good place to store runtime variables and values, links to logging, tracing, or dashboard tools, and more static data that does not change between deployments.

Let's manually create a deployment config Entity for the `Notification Service` service in the `Production` environment:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "notification-service-prod",
  "title": "Notification Service Production",
  "properties": {
    "healthStatus": "Healthy",
    "newRelicUrl": "https://newrelic.com",
    "sentryUrl": "https://sentry.io/",
    "prometheusUrl": "https://prometheus.io",
    "locked": false
  },
  "relations": {
    "environment": "production",
    "service": "notification-service"
  }
}
```

Below is a `python` code snippet to create this deployment config:

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the code</summary>

```python showLineNumbers
import requests

CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'

API_URL = 'https://api.getport.io/v1'

target_blueprint = 'deploymentConfig'

credentials = {'clientId': CLIENT_ID, 'clientSecret': CLIENT_SECRET}

token_response = requests.post(f'{API_URL}/auth/access_token', json=credentials)

access_token = token_response.json()['accessToken']

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'
}

entity = {
    "identifier": "notification-service-prod",
    "title": "Notification Service Production",
    "properties": {
        "healthStatus": "Healthy",
        "newRelicUrl": "https://newrelic.com",
        "sentryUrl": "https://sentry.io/",
        "prometheusUrl": "https://prometheus.io",
        "locked": False
    },
    "relations": {
        "environment": "production",
        "service": "notification-service"
    }
}


response = requests.post(f'{API_URL}/blueprints/{target_blueprint}/entities', json=entity, headers=headers)

print(response.json())
```

</details>

### Deployed Service Pod - K8s Exporter

A deployment service pod represents an instance of a deployed service. A deployment service pod has a `deployment config` tied to it, which represents the deployed service that the pod is an instance of.

Below is a `config.yaml` configuration file to use as the [Kubernetes Exporter](../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/kubernetes/kubernetes.md) config:

<details>
<summary>Click here to see the config</summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
resources:
  - kind: v1/pods
    selector:
      query: .metadata.namespace | startswith("kube") | not
    port:
      entity:
        mappings:
          - identifier: .metadata.name
            title: .metadata.name
            blueprint: '"deployedServicePod"'
            properties:
              startTime: .status.startTime
              phase: .status.phase
              labels: .metadata.labels
              containers: (.spec.containers | map({image, resources})) + .status.containerStatuses | group_by(.image) | map(add)
              conditions: .status.conditions
            relations:
              deploymentConfig: .metadata.labels."app.kubernetes.io/name" + "-prod"
```

</details>

Time to move on to the final stage: consistent deployment reporting.

### Deployment - GitHub Action

To keep track of your services, you will implement a [Github Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) that will create a new deployment Entity every time code is merged to the `main` branch of your service repo.

:::tip
The example we're working with here assumes you only have one service in your repository, but the workflow file we are going to create can be the template for a workflow file that creates a specific deployment Entity based on provided parameters.
:::

In your repository create a directory called `.github` under the repository root, inside the new directory, create a `workflows` directory.

Now inside the `/.github/workflows` directory create a file called `report-deployment.yml` with the following content:

```yml showLineNumbers
name: Report Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

jobs:
  report-deployment:
    name: Report new deployment Entity
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Extract SHA short
        run: echo "SHA_SHORT=${GITHUB_SHA:0:7}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: "Report deployment Entity to port 🚢"
        uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
        with:
          clientId: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_ID }}
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          identifier: notification-service-prod-${{ env.SHA_SHORT }}
          title: Notification-Service-Production-${{ env.SHA_SHORT }}
          blueprint: deployment
          properties: |
            {
               "jobUrl": "${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}",
               "deployingUser": "${{ github.actor }}",
               "imageTag": "latest",
               "commitSha": "${{ env.SHA_SHORT }}"
            }
          relations: |
            {
               "deploymentConfig": "notification-service-prod"
            }
```

:::tip
For security reasons it is recommended to save the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), and access them as shown in the example above.

:::

## Summary

At this point, you should have a basic software catalog up and running, with new deployment Entities being created in Port, allowing you to keep track of how your code changes across your different environments.

This guide is only the start of your software catalog - go ahead and add more environments, more services, and more cloud infrastructure resources to give your developers a complete image of your infrastructure.

Then, begin providing [Self-Service](../self-service-actions/self-service-actions.md) capabilities to your developers.
