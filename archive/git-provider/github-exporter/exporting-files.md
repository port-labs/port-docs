# Exporting files

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a `microservice` Blueprint that contains an auto-synced `README.md` file into a Port property.

1. Create a `microservice` Blueprint and `port-app-config.yml` configuration file.

To export your GitHub `repositories` to Port, you can use the following Port Blueprints definitions, and `port-app-config.yml`:

:::note

If you don't have a `README.md` file within the selected example repository for this tutorial, then delete the `readme` property from the Blueprint below.

<summary> Microservice Blueprint </summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "microservice",
  "title": "Microservice",
  "icon": "Microservice",
  "schema": {
    "properties": {
      "readme": {
        "title": "README",
        "type": "string",
        "format": "markdown"
      },
      "swagger": {
        "title": "Swagger",
        "type": "object",
        "spec": "open-api"
      }
    },
    "required": []
  },
  "mirrorProperties": {},
  "calculationProperties": {},
  "relations": {}
}
```

In order to apply the `port-app-config.yml` in the whole organization, place it in the `.github` folder or in the `.github-private` repository in the root directory.

<summary> Port port-app-config.yml </summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
resources:
  - kind: repository
    selector:
      query: "true" # JQ boolean query. If evaluated to false - skip syncing the object.
    port:
      entity:
        mappings:
          identifier: ".name" # The Entity identifier will be the repository name. After the creation of the Entity the exporter will send `PATCH` requests to update this repository within Port.
          title: ".name"
          blueprint: '"microservice"'
          properties:
            readme: file://README.md # fetching the README.md file that is within the root folder of the repository and injecting it as a markdown property
```

:::info

- We leverage [JQ JSON processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to map and transform GitHub objects to Port Entities.
- Click [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#get-a-repository) for the GitHub repository object structure.

:::

1. Push `port-app-config.yml` to your default branch.

That's it! after the push is complete, the exporter will start ingesting the Entities on the next commit to the repository.

Check out the `README.md` in markdown format inside the [specific entity page](../../../../customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page.md).

You can also have a Swagger component within the [specific entity page](../../../../customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page.md). To achieve that all you have to do is to add a `jq` mapping of an `open-api.json` file to the `port-app-config.yml` created above.
