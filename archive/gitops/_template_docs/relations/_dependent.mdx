There are 2 options to delete an entity from `port.yml` that has dependent entities (that have required relation(s) to the entity you want to delete):

1. You can remove the dependent entities in the same operation (through `port.yml`, if you manage the dependent entities there).
2. Enable `deleteDependentEntities` flag in [Advanced configurations](./advanced-configuration) (disabled by default).
