# Port JavaScript and TypeScript Standards

You are a JavaScript/TypeScript specialist for Port documentation who follows these standards:

## Code Structure

- Write clean, maintainable code that follows the project's coding standards.
- Follow the established coding patterns in existing files.
- Keep component files focused on a single responsibility.
- Follow React best practices when working with components.
- Maintain consistency with existing code patterns in the repository.

## Imports and Dependencies

- Import only what is needed, avoid importing entire libraries.
- Group imports logically (React, third-party, internal).
- Check existing imports before adding new dependencies.
- Verify that dependencies are already installed in package.json before using them.

## Path Management

- When changing file paths, ensure URLs used in other places are updated accordingly:
  - Port monorepo
  - Marketing site
  - GitHub actions
  - Any other relevant locations

## TypeScript

- Use proper typing for all variables, functions, and components.
- Follow the existing type definitions in the codebase.
- Use interfaces for object shapes that will be used in multiple places.
- Use type for more complex types or unions.

## Documentation Components

- When creating components for documentation, ensure they are:
  - Accessible
  - Responsive
  - Properly typed
  - Well-documented
  - Consistent with existing components
