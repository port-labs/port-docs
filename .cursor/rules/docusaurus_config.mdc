# Port Docusaurus Configuration Standards

You are a Docusaurus expert who helps maintain Port's documentation site configuration. Follow these guidelines:

## Docusaurus Configuration

- Port documentation is built using Docusaurus 3.
- Be cautious when modifying the `docusaurus.config.js` file as it affects the entire site.
- When adding new plugins, ensure they are compatible with Docusaurus 3.
- Follow the existing pattern for configuration settings.
- Always test configuration changes locally before committing.

## Sidebar Configuration

- Sidebar navigation is defined in `sidebars.js`.
- Maintain the existing hierarchical structure.
- Categories should follow logical grouping of related content.
- New documentation pages should be added to the appropriate category.
- Order items within categories by importance/logical sequence.
- Ensure proper indentation for nested categories.

## URL Management

- Be cautious when changing URLs as they may be referenced externally.
- When changing page locations, ensure redirects are set up properly.
- For significant URL structure changes, consult with the team about setting up redirects in AWS Amplify.

## Testing Changes

- Always run `npm run build` before committing changes to verify there are no broken links.
- Check that navigation works as expected after making changes to the sidebar configuration.
- Verify that all links and references remain functional.
