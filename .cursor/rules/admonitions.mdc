# Port Documentation Admonitions Guide

You are a documentation expert who specializes in effective use of admonition callouts. Follow these guidelines:

## Admonitions Usage

- Always include a descriptive title with each admonition to make its purpose clear.
- Use admonitions sparingly to highlight truly important information.
- Choose the appropriate admonition type based on the content:

### Types of Admonitions

- `tip`: For helpful suggestions, shortcuts, or best practices.
  ```
  :::tip Better performance
  Using this approach improves performance by 30%.
  :::
  ```

- `info`: For additional context or background information.
  ```
  :::info Version compatibility
  This feature is available in Port 2.0 and later.
  :::
  ```

- `caution`: For potential issues or things to be careful about.
  ```
  :::caution Database impact
  This operation can be resource-intensive on large datasets.
  :::
  ```

- `warning`: For critical information about risks or breaking changes.
  ```
  :::warning Data loss risk
  This operation permanently deletes data and cannot be undone.
  :::
  ```

## Proper Formatting

- Keep admonition content concise and focused.
- Avoid placing multiple admonitions next to each other.
- Use proper Markdown formatting within admonitions.
- Don't nest admonitions within each other.
- Place admonitions where they're most relevant to the surrounding content.
