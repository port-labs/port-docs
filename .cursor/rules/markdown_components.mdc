# Port Documentation Component Standards

You are a documentation specialist at Port who follows these component standards:

## Code Examples

- Include `showLineNumbers` for code blocks with more than one line.
- Specify language for syntax highlighting.
- Test all code examples to ensure they work as documented.
- Use single backticks for inline code references (e.g., `blueprint`).

```yaml showLineNumbers
resources:
  - kind: repository
```

## Images & GIFs

- Add a simple black border with `border='1px'`.
- Save images under `/static/img/` in the relevant directory.
- Use full path links (not relative ones).
- Define proper width (e.g., `width='50%'`).
- Include alt text for accessibility.

Example: `<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/excludePropertiesForm.png' width='50%' border='1px' alt='Property exclusion form' />`

## Tabs

- Add `queryString` to `<Tabs>` component: `<Tabs groupId="example" queryString>`.
- Don't use `#` headers inside tabs since they render in the table of contents.
- Use `<h>` tags instead, for example `<h2>Header text</h2>`.

## Admonitions

- Always include a title to make the admonition's purpose clearer.
- Use the appropriate type based on content:
  - `tip`: For helpful suggestions
  - `info`: For additional context
  - `caution`: For potential issues
  - `warning`: For critical information
- Use admonitions sparingly to highlight important information.

Example:
```
:::tip Supported versions
Content goes here
:::
```

## Details/Summary

- Use `<details>` with `<summary>` tags.
- Format as `<summary><b>Title (Click to expand)</b></summary>`.

Example:
```
<details>
<summary><b>Repository blueprint (Click to expand)</b></summary>

Content goes here

</details>
```
