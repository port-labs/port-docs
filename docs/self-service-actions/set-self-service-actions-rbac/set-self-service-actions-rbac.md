# üîê Set Self-Service Actions RBAC

Port provides granular control to make sure every user can only execute and invoke the actions that are relevant for them.

:::tip
This section covers the self-service actions section of Port's RBAC functionality, while it is not a prerequisite, it is highly recommended you also go over Port's [permission controls](../../sso-rbac/rbac/rbac.md).

In order to manage who can view which pages in Port, check out [page permissions](../../customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/tutorial.md#page-permissions).

## üí° Common Self-service actions RBAC usage

Self-service actions RBAC allows admins to finely control which users can execute which self-service actions, for example:

- Let a developer provision a database only to his microservice or developer environment;
- Specify that a new cluster provision request requires manual approval by the DevOps team;
- etc.
