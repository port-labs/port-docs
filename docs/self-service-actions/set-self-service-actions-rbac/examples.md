# Examples

In this section we'll show you a few examples of ways to use self-service action permissions in your organization, and how to apply them.

## Use cases ðŸ’¡

The following configurations, among others, are available when using self-service action permissions management:

1. Self-service actions can be enabled only for specific users;
2. Allow specific users/roles to only execute specific self-service actions;
3. Specify users that are allowed to approve self-service action requests;

## Setting blueprint permissions

To set permissions for a self-service action, click on the permissions button of the blueprint with the desired self-service action in the DevPortal Builder page. This will open a modal that contains the permissions JSON and allows you to control every operation that can be performed on the blueprint or its entities.

## Setting action permissions

### Role examples

<Tabs groupId="action-permissions" defaultValue="action-only-admin-moderator" values={[
{label: "Only let admins/moderators run action", value: "action-only-admin-moderator"}
]}>

<TabItem value="action-only-admin-moderator">

By default, **Member** users can execute every action defined on a blueprint. In this example, we allow only **Moderators** (and **Admins**) to only execute the action `clone_env` (and disabling Member's permission to execute it):

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "actions": {
    "clone_env": {
      "execute": {
        // highlight-next-line
        "roles": ["Admin", "Env-moderator"], // changed from ["Admin", "Env-moderator", "Member"]
        "users": [],
        "teams": [],
        "ownedByTeam": false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
