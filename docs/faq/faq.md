## What is Port, and how does it work?

Port lets you quickly build a developer portal for your software, microservices and resources. This means that you can help developers get an application working by providing the relevant data about DevOps and infrastructure.

In doing this, Port also creates a single source of truth for engineering architecture, assets and dependencies, with no spreadsheets or other tracking methods. 

Port is powered by a catalog of software, microservices and resources. Based on the catalog, DevOps or platform teams can enable developer self-service offering both a better developer experience, as well as quality and control over software development and the underlying resources.

Self-service is done according to standards/templates (or guardrails) requiring security, compliance or best practices, all defined by platform or DevOps teams, freeing developers from dealing with complexity but ensuring quality at the same time. Port offers pre-built best practice templates or you can build your own.

Port’s approach is [builder-based](#whats-a-builder-based-developer-portal), meaning that you define what’s exposed to developers and what isn’t, how teams see the software they own, and any other resources - CI/CD flows, dev environments, pipelines, deployments and anything cloud. Using port means no more orphan dev environments, dependencies or microservices remain in the dark, affecting costs and manageability. 

## What are the main use cases for Port?

- A microservice catalog - detailing owners, who’s on-call, linking to github, logs etc
- A software catalog - environments, versions, permissions, CI/CD flows etc
- A resource catalog - cloud resources, multi-cloud observations, in-house resrouces and services
- A self-service portal - provisioning, 2nd day operations and terminations on cataloged assets, using a dynamic UI
- All of the above

## What’s a “builder-based” developer portal?

Port’s basic approach is to provide maximum flexibility so you can build your asset landscape according to your needs. 

## Why not backstage?

Spotify’s backstage is spot-on in recognizing the need for a streamlined end-to-end development environment. Yet, as an open-source tool, it requires significant engineering resources for deployment, configuration and updates. Port is a hosted alternative to Backstage, saving most of the effort involved in setting backstage up, with none of the hassle and toil involved in setting up and maintaining an open source project. Port allows you to skip the build part of open source and quickly set up the internal developer portal you need.

## How is Port different?

Taking a builder-based approach means that you can make Port developer portals exactly the way you need them, in minutes. The same applies to setting standards or allowing self-service. While microservices may be at the center of a developer portal, they aren’t all that’s needed. Developer portals are about consolidating all developer needs in one place. Cataloging underlying resources and allowing self-service, from setting up a VM  to a dev env, is just as valuable to engineering teams. With a 100% agnostic approach, minutes to setup and a zero infrastructure footprint, everyone finds what they need in Port.

## Is it free?

Port provides a free forever plan for up to 2 devex seats and 15 developers. Above that, please refer to our [pricing](https://www.getport.io/pricing), which is based on a $19/month charge per developer using the platform.

## What happens when I request a free trial?

Port is about to become a self-service platform. Until that happens, we’d like to offer a free 15 minute call after which you’ll be able to set up Port for yourself. We also offer dedicated slack support (support gets even better for paid options).

## What security does Port have in place?

Port was built with security in mind, deeply integrated into our SDLC with controls such as Software Composition Analysis, Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing, and Security Design and Implementation reviews. 

In addition, our unique architecture has a zero-footprint on your infrastructure developer portal. This means you do not have to install any 3rd party software to use Port’s solution.
