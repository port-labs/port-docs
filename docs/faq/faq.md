# FAQ

## How can I get started?

Port is open for self-service, so you are invited to [open an account](https://app.getport.io/?screen_hint=login) and start building your developer portal right away. In addition, feel free to request a [private demo](https://www.getport.io/free-trial) with our team.

## What is Port, and how does it work?

Port is a developer portal for your software, microservices and resources. With Port, you can help developers develop applications quickly and efficiently, by providing them the relevant data about DevOps and infrastructure.

In doing this, Port also creates a single source of truth for engineering architecture, assets, and dependencies, with no spreadsheets or other tracking methods.

Port is powered through a catalog of software, microservices, and resources. Based on the catalog, DevOps or platform teams can enable developer self-service, offering both a better developer experience, as well as quality and control over software development and the underlying resources.

Self-service is done according to standards/templates (or guardrails), defined by platform or DevOps teams. This frees developers from dealing with complexity while at the same time ensures quality. Port offers pre-built best-practice templates, or you can build your own.

Port’s approach is [builder-based](#whats-a-builder-based-developer-portal), meaning you have full control of your infrastructure: you define what’s exposed to developers and what isn’t, how teams see the software they own, and any other resources (CI/CD flows, dev environments, pipelines, deployments, and anything cloud). Using Port means no more orphan dev environments, dependencies, or microservices remaining in the dark affecting costs and manageability.

## What are the main use cases for Port?

- Microservice catalog - owners, who’s on-call, linking to Github, logs etc;
- Software catalog - environments, versions, permissions, CI/CD flows etc;
- Resource catalog - cloud resources, multi-cloud observations, in-house resources, and services;
- Self-service portal - provisioning, 2nd-day operations and terminations on cataloged assets, using a dynamic UI;
- All of the above.

## What’s a “builder-based” developer portal?

Port’s basic approach is to provide maximum flexibility, so you will have the ability to build your asset landscape according to your needs.

## Why not backstage?

Spotify’s backstage is correct in recognizing the need for a streamlined end-to-end development environment. Yet, as an open-source tool, it requires significant engineering resources for deployment, configuration and updates. Port is a hosted alternative to Backstage, saving most of the effort involved in setting backstage up, with none of the hassle and toil involved in setting up and maintaining an open source project. Port allows you to skip the build part of open source and quickly set up the internal developer portal you need.

## How is Port different?

With our builder-based approach you can make Port developer portals exactly the way you need them, in minutes. The same applies to setting standards or allowing self-service. While microservices may be at the center of a developer portal, they aren’t all that’s needed. Developer portals are about consolidating all developer needs in one place. Cataloging underlying resources and allowing self-service, from setting up a VM to a dev env, is just as valuable to engineering teams. With a 100% agnostic approach, minutes to setup and a zero infrastructure footprint, everyone finds what they need in Port.

## Is it free?

Port provides a free forever plan for up to 10 users per month. Above that, please refer to our [pricing page](https://www.getport.io/pricing).

## What security does Port have in place?

Port was built with security in mind, deeply integrated into our SDLC with controls such as Software Composition Analysis, Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing, and Security Design and Implementation reviews.

In addition, our unique architecture has a zero-footprint on your infrastructure developer portal. This means you do not have to install any 3rd party software to use Port’s solution.
