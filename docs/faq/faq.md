# ❓ FAQ

## How can I get started?

You can create a free [Port account](https://app.getport.io) and start building your internal developer portal right away. We suggest completing the [onboarding process](/quickstart), which will help you get a basic understanding of Port and an idea of how a good developer portal can help you and your developers.

You can also schedule an [in-person demo](https://www.getport.io/demo-request) with us, and we’ll be happy to show you a demo and discuss your needs.

## Do I need an expert to set up an Internal Developer Portal with Port?

Port was designed to let you set up a developer portal in minutes, quickly defining your data model and then ingesting data about software and resources into it.

We believe in “bring your own data model” since each organization differs in how it wants to set up Port and model its software. Our documentation and [other resources](/resources) can help you get started. 

If you're trying to find out if Port is right for you, you can reach out to us by scheduling an [in-person demo](https://www.getport.io/demo-request), and we’ll be happy to escort you through the process of building a portal that's right for you.

## Why not backstage?

Spotify’s backstage is spot-on in recognizing the need for a streamlined end-to-end development environment. It is also flexible, which lets you build your software catalog according to your data model. Yet, it requires coding, personnel to implement and domain expertise. You also need to invest in deployment, configuration and updates. You can read a detailed comparison of Port and Backstage [here](https://www.getport.io/compare/backstage-vs-port).

## Is Port really free?

Yes. Anything that is free in our pricing page is, well, free. Using the free version of Port you can set up an advanced, fully functioning internal developer portal, unlimited in time.

The free version includes all of the features in Port, except for SSO and a certain limitation on the number of software catalog entities (up to 10,000), for reasons of fair use. In case you're evaluating Port, it provides you with everything you need, and if you need SSO for a given period, contact us.

## What security does Port have in place?

Port is SOC2 compliant.

We make use of industry standard encryption protocols. All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit, with complete isolation between clients and data access logging and auditing.
