# FAQ ❓

## How can I get started?

Port is open for self-service. You can open a Port account and start building your internal developer portal right away. It’s free forever. We don’t do free trials - if you’re opening an account and don’t need any of our paid features, we won’t send you a “pay now or else” message.

You can also schedule an [in-person demo](https://www.getport.io/demo-request) with us, and we’ll be happy to show you a demo and discuss your needs...

## Do I need an expert to set up an Internal Developer Portal with Port?

Port was designed to let you set up a developer portal in minutes, quickly defining your data model and then ingesting data about software and resources into it.

We believe in “bring your own data model” since different engineering orgs differ in how they want to set up Port and model their software. The next simple step is adding developer self-service over existing automations, using our tools and wizards.

Our blog has several articles that deal with how to set up the portal, and our docs can also help. If not, feel free to drop us a note or ask for an in-person demo.

## Is Port a cloud or self-hosted solution??

Port is both SaaS and cloud based and will support a self-hosted solution based on a K8s operator.

## Why not backstage?

Spotify’s backstage is spot-on in recognizing the need for a streamlined end-to-end development environment. It is also flexible, which lets you build your software catalog according to your data model. Yet, it requires coding, personnel to implement and domain expertise. You also need to invest in deployment, configuration and updates. You can read a detailed comparison of Port and Backstage [here](https://www.getport.io/compare/backstage-vs-port).

## Is Port really free?

Yes. Anything that is free in our [pricing page](https://www.getport.io/pricing) is, well, free. Using the free version of Port you can set up an advanced, fully functioning internal developer portal, with no free trial limits.

## What security does Port have in place?

Port is SOC2 compliant.
