## What is Port

Welcome to Port! :wave:

Internal developer portals need a context-rich software catalog with maturity and quality scorecards. They also must support comprehensive developer self-service actions. Port has it all.

#### Workflow automation

With Port, you can set up automations to automatically respond to events from your software catalog such as `TTL=0`, service degradation, and many more. This allows you to streamline your engineering processes, maintain a high level of performance, security, and compliance, and ensure your systems run smoothly.

#### R&D Insights & Reports

R&D Insights & Reports is a pillar of port that provides data-driven insights and analytical reports on the development process. It allows teams, developers, and management to make informed decisions based on metrics, trends, and usage patterns to improve the development process, optimize performance, and reduce cost.
