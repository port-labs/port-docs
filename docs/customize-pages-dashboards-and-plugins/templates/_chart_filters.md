[Pie charts](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/data-widgets/#pie-chart), [number charts](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/data-widgets/#number-chart) and [tables](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/data-widgets/#table) support filters, which allow you to include or exclude specific data from them. The filters are based on Port's [Search Rules](/search-and-query/structure-and-syntax#rules), and are set when creating the widget:
