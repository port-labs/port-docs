Port supports various visualizations in the form of widgets, allowing you to display data from your software catalog using graphic elements, making it easier to make sense of large datasets.

Dashboards are available in the following locations:

1. The [Home page](https://app.getport.io/organization/home) of your Port app - the home page itself is a dashboard, allowing you to add and customize any of the widgets described on this page.
2. Every [entity page](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page#dashboard-widgets) can have a `dashboard` tab with its own widgets.
3. The [software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services) allows you to create customizable [dashboard pages](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/dashboard-page).
