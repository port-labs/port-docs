When you customize a table by filtering, sorting, or hiding columns, the changes will be **automatically saved** for you in the browser's local storage. If you log out and log back in, the table will display the same view you left it in.  

Additionally, any such change will cause a `Save view` button to appear in the top right corner of the table:

<img src='/img/software-catalog/widgets/saveTableView.png' width='90%' border='1px' />

Using this button, you can save the new view for **all users** in your organization.  
The `revert`(â†º) button next to it will revert the table to the last saved view.

:::info Admin role
The ability to save a view for all users is available only for the [Admin role](/sso-rbac/rbac/rbac.md#roles).
