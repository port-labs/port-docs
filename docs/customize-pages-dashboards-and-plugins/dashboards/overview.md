## Widget types

Port offers three types of widgets:

1. **[Data widgets](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/data-widgets)** - Visualization widgets that display data from your software catalog, including charts, tables, and entity information.
2. **[Custom widgets](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/custom-widgets)** - Specialized widgets that provide additional functionality beyond data visualization, such as executing actions, displaying external content, or showing formatted markdown content.
3. **[Personal widgets](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/personal-widgets)** - User-specific widgets that display information tailored to the logged-in user, such as their entities, recently viewed items, and recently used actions. These widgets are only available in the home page of your portal.

Dashboards are available in the following locations:

1. The [Home page](https://app.getport.io/organization/home) of your Port app - the home page itself is a dashboard, allowing you to add and customize any of the widgets described on this page.
2. Every [entity page](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page#dashboard-widgets) can have a `dashboard` tab with its own widgets.
3. The [software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services) allows you to create customizable [dashboard pages](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/dashboard-page).
