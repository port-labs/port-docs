# Entity page

Each [entity](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog.md#entity-json-structure) has a dedicated page that contains 4 tabs (by default):

- [Overview](#overview)
- [Related entities](#related-entities)
- [Runs](#runs)
- [Audit log](#audit-log)

## Overview

The overview tab is a dashboard, used to display [widgets](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/) related to the entity.

By default, each entity will have a `Details` widget, which displays the entity's properties and their values, and other metadata.

### Manage properties

In the top right corner of the details widget, you can find the <LogoImage logo="ManageProperties" verticalAlign="middle" /> button that opens the "manage properties" modal, which allows you to:

- Show/hide empty values - properties with empty values will be hidden if the toggle is off.
- Show/hide specific properties in the widget.

Additional widgets can be added by clicking on the `+ Widget` button in the top right corner of the dashboard.

## Related entities

By default, all related entities in the same direction will automatically appear in this table. This is true for both forward-related and backward-related entities. Indirectly-related entities will not appear but can be added manually,
check out the [indirect relations](#indirect-relation) section on how to add indirectly related entities.

For example:

`Workflow Run` has a forward-relation to `Deployment Workflow`, which has a forward-relation to `Service`, which has a **backward**-relation to `Deployment`.  
Since we changed direction midway, this relation is **indirect**:

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/builderRelationsExample.png' border='1px' />

When looking at the entity page of a certain `Workflow Run`, the related entities `Deployment Workflow` and `Service` automatically appear, but `Deployment` does not, since its relation is in the other direction.

### Add a Related entities tab

1. Click the `+` button above the table to add a custom tab.

    <img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/relatedEntitieNewTab.png' border='1px' width='50%' />
    <br />

2. Fill in the form:

    <img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/relatedEntitiesDetails.png' border='1px' width='50%' />

      - Set the tab's `Name` and optional `Description`.

      - Choose the `Related blueprint` you want to display.

      - Pick a `Relation path`:
        - **All paths** – includes all available paths from the current blueprint to the target blueprint.
        - **Specific path** – choose the specific relation chain.

      - (Optional) Add `Additional filters` to restrict the result set.


:::tip Relation path options
The relation path dropdown displays straightforward, acyclic paths. For complex scenarios involving circular relationships, advanced path configurations, multiple self-relations, or maxHops, use [JSON mode](#filters-and-edit-json).

Using "All paths" is less performant than selecting a specific path, as it requires the system to evaluate multiple relationship paths.
:::

#### Additional filters

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/jsonTogglerAddTab.png' border='1px' width='50%' />
<br /><br />

Selecting `Filters` opens a dialog where you can build conditions using form controls (property, operator, value).   
You can switch to a JSON editor using the `Edit JSON` button to define the dataset directly.

The filters visual editor doesn't support nested queries so in the case of nested queries, use the JSON editor to define the dataset.

The dataset follows this structure based on the [search and query syntax](https://docs.port.io/search-and-query):

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "combinator": "and",
  "rules": [
    {
      "property": "$title",
      "operator": "contains",
      "value": "awesome-package"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the JSON editor when you need to copy/paste filter sets, keep them in source control, or express conditions that are faster to author as JSON. You can toggle back to the form at any time.

<h4>Define the tab in JSON mode</h4>

You can also toggle `Json Mode` in the "Add tab" dialog to author the entire tab as JSON. An example:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "dataset": {
    "combinator": "and",
    "rules": [
      {
        "property": "$title",
        "operator": "contains",
        "value": "awesome-package"
      }
    ]
  },
  "title": "custom path package",
  "targetBlueprint": "Package",
  "relationPath": {
    "path": ["service_in_env", "package"],
    "fromBlueprint": "service_in_env_deployments"
  }
}
```

This JSON corresponds to a tab named `custom path package` that targets the `Package` blueprint, follows a specific path from `service_in_env_deployments` via `service_in_env` to `package`, and filters results to titles containing the letter `awesome-package`.

#### Show/hide columns

By default, the related entities table will display the following columns for each entity:  
`Title`, `Last update time`, and `Creation time`.  
Other properties will be hidden by default.  

You can always customize the table to [hide/show columns](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/catalog-page?create-page=ui#hideshow-columns).

#### Indirect relations

In some scenarios, you may want to display entities that are not directly related but connected through a common blueprint. This is useful when you have multiple services that share relationships with a common entity.

For example, consider this relationship structure:

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/relatedEntitiesIndirectRelations.png' border='1px' width='95%' />

<br /><br />

From the diagram, we can see that:

- **Deployment Workflow** has a relation to **Microservice**
- **Deployment** has relations to **Microservice** (including `relation_1` and `relation_2`)
- **Deployment Workflow** and **Deployment** are not directly related, but connected through **Microservice**

When you're on the entity page of a **Deployment Workflow**, the related entity **Microservice** automatically appears, but **Deployment** does not, since its relation is in the other direction. However, you can create a custom tab to show **Deployment** entities by leveraging the indirect relationship through **Microservice**.


<h4>Add a tab for an indirectly related blueprint</h4>


1. Click the `+` button above the Related Entities table.

2. Set the tab name and description.

3. Choose **Deployment** as the `Related blueprint`.

4. For the `Relation or property`, select the specific relation from **Deployment Workflow** to **Microservice** that you want to traverse.

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/relatedEntitiesIndirectRelations2.png' border='1px' width='100%' />

This approach allows you to display indirectly related entities while maintaining control over the specific relationship path used for the connection.

:::info Multiple relations scenario
If **Deployment Workflow** has multiple relations to **Microservice** (e.g., `deployment_target` and `monitoring_target`), you can choose which specific relation path to use for more refined and filtered results.

Additionally, when you have an existing relation between blueprints, Port automatically creates a mirror property relation that allows you to traverse the relationship in both directions. This mirror relation will appear as an option in the relation dropdown, enabling you to explore connections from either side of the relationship.
:::

#### Self-relation

A self-relation allows a blueprint to establish a relationship with itself. This is useful when you want entities of the same blueprint to be related to other entities within that same blueprint.

For example, consider a **Team** blueprint where:
- Organizations contain teams.
- Teams can belong to other organizational entities (like groups).

All entities share the same blueprint but have hierarchical relationships.

When defining a self-relation, you can specify how many "hops" to traverse in the relationship chain.   
Hops represent the number of jumps you want to make upstream or downstream through the self-relation.

:::tip Create a self-relation
Before performing the following steps, make sure the desired blueprint has a relation to itself.

<details>
<summary><b>Add self-relation (click to exapnd)</b></summary>
1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.
2. Choose the relevant blueprint.
3. Click the `+ New relation` button.
4. Give the property a `title`, choose the same blueprint in the `Related to` field.
5. Choose the entity limit and whether its required.
6. Click `Save`.
</details>
:::

**Set up self-relations tab**

To add a self-relation tab to the related entities:

1. Click the `+` button in the **Related Entities** table.

2. Choose your blueprint as the **Related blueprint**.

3. Select the self-relation path from the available paths.  

4. If you want to traverse more than one hop, switch to `Json mode`. 

   In JSON mode you can:
   - Specify multiple self-relation identifiers (for fixed hops).
     ```json showLineNumbers
      "relationPath": {
      "path": [
        "self_relation",
        "self_relation"
        ]
      }
     ```
     
   - Use maxHops (for variable hops).
     ```json showLineNumbers
      "relationPath": {
        {
          "relation": "<SELF_RELATION_IDENTIFIER>",
          "maxHops": <number between 1 and 15>
        }
      }
      ```
   - Combine fixed hops with maxHops for mixed control.

      ```json showLineNumbers
      "relationPath": {
        "path": [
          "self_relation",
          {
            "relation": "<SELF_RELATION_IDENTIFIER>",
            "maxHops": <number between 1 and 15>
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      :::info `maxHops` limitation
      The `maxHops` parameter can only be applied **once** per path, and it accepts values from **1 to 15**.
      :::

5. Click on `Save` to save the tab.

:::info Self-relation identifier
Note that `self_relation` in these examples represents the identifier of the self-relation you created in your blueprint. Replace it with your actual self-relation identifier.
:::


**Examples**

Let's take a look at some examples using the concept of Teams.

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/relatedEntitiesTeamExample.png' border='1px' width='90%' />

<br /><br />

**Basic self-relation with multiple self-relations:**

If you want **exactly 2 hops**, specify the relation twice:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "dataset": {
    "combinator": "and",
    "rules": []
  },
  "title": "Team Hierarchy",
  "targetBlueprint": "Team",
  "relationPath": {
    "path": [
      "self_relation",
      "self_relation"
    ],
    "fromBlueprint": "Team"
  }
}
```
In this case, the added tab under the `Unit` entity should show the `Group` entity.

**Self-relation with maxHops for variable hops:**

If you want a variable number of hops (between 1 and 15), use maxHops:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "dataset": {
    "combinator": "and",
    "rules": []
  },
  "title": "Team Hierarchy",
  "targetBlueprint": "Team",
  "relationPath": {
    "path": [
      {
        "relation": "team_self_relation",
        "maxHops": 4
      }
    ],
    "fromBlueprint": "Team"
  }
}
```

In this case, the added tab under the `Unit` entity should show the `Basic Team`, `Group` and `Office` entities.

**Mixed approach example:**

You can also mix fixed hops with variable hops. For example, if you specify `self_relation` twice followed by a `maxHops` object, the system will start traversing from the 2 hops already made and continue with the additional hops specified in `maxHops`.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "title": "Team Hierarchy",
  "targetBlueprint": "Team",
  "dataset": {
    "combinator": "and",
    "rules": []
  },
  "relationPath": {
    "path": [
      "self_relation",    // 1st hop: Unit -> Basic Team
      "self_relation",    // 2nd hop: Basic Team -> Group  
      {
        "relation": "team_self_relation",
        "maxHops": 3      // Continues from Group, adding up to 3 more hops (Group -> Office -> etc.)
      }
    ],
    "fromBlueprint": "Team"
  }
}
```

In this example, the system will traverse 2 fixed hops (`Unit` → `Basic Team` → `Group`) and then continue with up to 3 additional hops using the `team_self_relation`, starting from where the fixed hops left off. This could represent a complete organizational hierarchy from Unit all the way up to higher-level organizational structures.

In this case, the added tab under the `Unit`entity should show the `Group` and `Office` entities.

**Simple relation path example:**

You can also use regular relations (not self-relations) in your paths:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "dataset": {
    "combinator": "and",
    "rules": []
  },
  "title": "Developer",
  "targetBlueprint": "developer",
  "relationPath": {
    "path": [
      "member_of"
    ]
  }
}
```

:::info The fromBlueprint property
The `fromBlueprint` property is only needed when the path starts from the current page's blueprint and ends with the entities listed in the tab. For more information about relation paths  see the [Relation operators](https://docs.port.io/search-and-query/#relation-operators) documentation.
:::


## Runs

If the entity's blueprint has any [actions](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/) configured, the `Runs` tab will display their history log, results, log streams, and more.

## Audit log

This tab displays all actions (including CRUD) that caused any change to the entity's configuration.  
For each change, useful metadata will be shown such as the initiator, diff before and after the change, relevant blueprint, and more.

## Additional tabs

### Visual properties
Some of the [available property types](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/#supported-properties) are visual by nature. When defining one of these properties in a blueprint, an additional tab will be automatically created in each entity page related to this blueprint, displaying the property's content in the relevant visual format.

The following property types are supported:

- [Markdown](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/markdown)
- [Embedded URL](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/embedded-url)
- [Swagger UI](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/swagger)

### Scorecards

If the entity's blueprint has any [scorecards](/scorecards/overview) configured, a `Scorecards` tab will be automatically created in the entity page.

The tab will display the entity's compliance status with each of its scorecards.

### Dashboard tabs

You can add additional, customizable dashboard tabs to an entity page by clicking the `+` button.  
Each dashboard tab name can be customized and edited.

#### Limitations
- You can add up to 5 dashboard tabs per entity page.
- Dashboard tab names must be unique and are limited to 30 characters.
