# Entity page

Each [entity](../../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog.md#entity-json-structure) has a specific page that contains two tabs (by default).

The first tab is the `Overview` tab, which shows two widgets: the entity details and a table(s) of its related entity(ies). The second tab is an `Audit Log` tab that contains a full-page table widget.

:::note Relations within an entity page
**Related entities** of an entity are presented on the entity page as a list of table widgets containing the related entity(ies) data.
