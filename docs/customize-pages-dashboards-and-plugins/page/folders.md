# Folders

Port allows you to create folders in your [software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services) that can be used to group pages by topic, team, or any other criteria that fits the needs of your organization.  

Folders can contain both [catalog pages](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/catalog-page) and [dashboard pages](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/dashboard-page), and can be nested up to 3 levels deep.

## Create a folder

To create a folder, simply click on `+ New` and choose `New folder`:

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/createNewFolder.gif' width='90%' />

<br/><br/>

You can also create a folder within another folder by clicking on the `...` button:

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/createNestedFolder.gif' width='90%' />

## Move pages between folders

To move a page into/out of a folder, hover over it, hold the `â ¿` icon and drag it to your desired location and depth: 

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/movePagesBetweenFolders.gif' width='90%' />

## Folder identifiers

Each folder has a unique identifier that can be used to reference it when working with the [Port API](/api-reference).  

When creating a folder, you will be asked to provide it with a title. The identifier is automatically generated from the titie using [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), which means that spaces and slashes are replaced with underscores and all letters are lowercase.

For example:
- A folder with the title `My Folder` will have the identifier `my_folder`.
- A folder with the title `CI/CD` will have the identifier `ci_cd`.
