# Dashboard page

Dashboards are collections of widgets that allow you to display entity data using graphic elements:

![dashboardExample](../../../static/img/software-catalog/pages/dashboardExample.png)

Similar to [catalog pages](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/catalog-page), dashboards reside in the panel on the left-hand side of the software catalog.  
Dashboards are a great way to display aggregated data and track the information that is relevant and/or interesting to you and your developers.

## Creating a dashboard page

You can create as many dashboards as you'd like. To create a dashboard, click on `New` and select `New dashboard`:

![newDashboard](../../../static/img/software-catalog/pages/newDashboard.png)

## Adding new widgets

A dashboard can include any of the [supported widgets](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/#visualization-types).

To add a new widget, click `Add` and choose your desired visualization type:

![dashboardPageAddVisualization](../../../static/img/software-catalog/pages/dashboardPageAddVisualization.png)

## Reordering and resizing widgets

Widgets can be expanded and/or moved within a dashboard page.

To move a widget, drag it from the top-left corner to your desired position:

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/widgetReorderExample.png' width='70%' />

<br/><br/>

To resize a widget, hover over one of its sides until the blue bar appears, then drag it to expand/shrink:

<img src='/img/software-catalog/pages/widgetResizeExample.png' width='70%' />
