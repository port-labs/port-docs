# Setting Self-Service Actions In Port

**Actions** in port make your Software Catalog active by configuring one of 3 actions types on Blueprints and their Entities:

- **Create** - A create action is meant to create a new entity, by triggering a provisioning process in your infrastructure
- **Delete** - A delete action will delete an existing entity, by triggering delete logic in your infrastructure
- **Day-2 Operations** - A Day-2 operation acts on an existing entity, and it will trigger logic in your infrastructure to update or modify the existing entity on request

## Configuring a new action

Let's configure new actions, starting with the Blueprints the actions will act upon

### Creating blueprints

For our example, letâ€™s create 2 blueprints and connect them to each other:

- **Blueprint #1**: Microservice
- **Blueprint #2**: Deployment

}
```

</details>

### Creating the blueprint action

In order to create an action, go to the Blueprints page, expand the Microservice blueprint and click on the `Create action` button as shown in the image:

![Create action button on blueprint marked](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/createActionOnBlueprintButtonMarked.png)

After clicking the button, you should see an editor appear with an empty array (`[]`), this is where we will add our action

Here is an example action array with a `CREATE` action already filled in:

```json showLineNumbers
[
	{
        "identifier": "Create",
        "title": "Create",
        "userInputs": {
            "properties": {
                "repo-user": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Repo User",
                    "default": "port-labs"
                },
                "repo-name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Repo Name",
                    "default": "*My-microservice*"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "repo-user"
            ]
        },
        "invocationMethod": "KAFKA",
        "trigger": "CREATE",
        "description": "This will create a new microservice repo"
    }
]
```

And here is how the JSON editor looks after entering the action:

![Action editor filled](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/microserviceEditorWithCreateAction.png)

Now when you go to the Microservices blueprint page, you will see a new button - `Create Microservice`:

![Create button marked](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/microservicePageWithCreateMarked.png)

When clicking the `Create Microservice` option, we will see a form with the inputs we specified when we entered the new action to the actions array:

![Action create form](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/actionCreateForm.png)

### Extending the example with more actions

Let's go back to the actions array of our `Microservice` blueprint and paste in the following JSON which has 2 additional actions configured:

```json showLineNumbers
[
    {
        "identifier": "Create",
        "title": "Create",
        "userInputs": {
            "properties": {
                "repo-user": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Repo User",
                    "default": "port-labs"
                },
                "repo-name": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Repo Name",
                    "default": "*My-microservice*"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "repo-user"
            ]
        },
        "invocationMethod": "KAFKA",
        "trigger": "CREATE",
        "description": "This will create a new microservice repo"
    },
    {
        "identifier": "Deploy",
        "title": "Deploy",
        "icon": "Deploy",
        "userInputs": {
            "properties": {
                "environment": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "enum": [
                        "Prod",
                        "Test",
                        "Staging"
                    ],
                    "title": "Environment"
                },
                "branch": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Branch Name"
                },
                "commit-hash": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Commit Hash"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "environment",
                "branch",
                "commit-hash"
            ]
        },
        "invocationMethod": "KAFKA",
        "trigger": "DAY-2",
        "description": "This will deploy the microservice"
    },
		{
        "identifier": "Delete",
        "title": "Delete",
        "userInputs": {
            "properties": {},
            "required": []
        },
        "invocationMethod": "KAFKA",
        "trigger": "DELETE",
        "description": "This will delete the microservice's repo"
    }
    
]
```

Now when we go back to the Microservice page, if we click on the 3 dots next to an existing entity, we should see the Day-2 and delete actions we just added:

**Day-2:**

![Day-2 button marked](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/day-2-action-marked.png)

**Delete:**

## Action definition structure

### Action JSON Structure

The basic structure of an action:

```json showLineNumbers
{
        "identifier": "UniqueID",
        "title": "Title",
        "userInputs": {
            "properties": {
                "property1": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Property title",
                    "default": "default value"
                },
                "property2": {
                    "type": "number",
                    "title": "property title",
                    "default": 5
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "repo-user"
            ]
        },
        "invocationMethod": "KAFKA",
        "trigger": "CREATE",
        "description": "Action description"
    }
```

### Structure table

| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `id` | Internal Action ID | 
| `identifier` | Action identifier | 
| `title` | Action title | 
| `icon` | Action icon | 
| `userInputs` | An object containing `properties` and `required` keys following the standard JSON schema format as seen in [Blueprint's structure](../port-components/blueprint.md#blueprints-structure) | 
| `invocationMethod` | The methods the action is dispatched in, currently only supports `KAFKA` |
| `trigger` | The type of the action, one of `CREATE`, `DAY-2`, `DELETE` |
| `description` | The description of the action |

### Properties structure table

The following table includes the different fields that can be specified in the `properties` key

| Field | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| `type` | All of the [types](../port-components/blueprint.md#property-types) supported by Port - `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc... | 
| `title` | The title shown in the form when calling the action |
| `description` (Optional) | Extra description about the requested property
| `default` (Optional) | A default value |
| `enum` (Optional) | A list of predefined values the user can choose from, same format as [enum](../port-components/blueprint.md#enum) |  

## Triggering actions

We will now look at trigger examples for each action type and explain what happens in the background when we execute each type

**What happens when the `Execute` button for an action is clicked:** A Port [Action message](#action-message-structure) will be published to the secure [runs Kafka topic](./port-execution-topics), from which you can pull it and run your own custom logic. 

For example, you can deploy a new version of your Microservice when a `CREATE` action is triggered.

### CREATE action

The action can be triggered from the page matching the Blueprint we configured the action on:

![Create button marked](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/microservicePageWithCreateMarked.png)

:::tip create vs register
When you define a `CREATE` action on a blueprint, when viewing the blueprint page you will notice that the create button now has a dropdown with 2 options: `Register` and `Create`

- `Register` - This option is used to add a new entity to your catalog, without triggering a `CREATE` action, this option is useful for cases where an entity in the infrastructure was created in the past without Port, and you want to import its data into the Software Catalog.

    This option is also useful for cases where an entity was created manually and you want to document it in Port after-the-fact.
- `Create` - This option will display the form containing the required `userInputs` of our actions, upon clicking execute, a new execution message will be sent to Port's Kafka Topics, and from there you can handle the create request in your infrastructure.
:::

When clicking the `Create Microservice` option, we will see a form with the inputs we specified when we entered the new action to the actions array:

![Action create form](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/actionCreateForm.png)

### DAY-2 action

The action can be triggered by selecting it from the sub-menu of an existing entity:

![Day-2 button marked](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/day-2-action-marked.png)

:::note DAY-2 actions
All of the DAY-2 operations will appear in this sub-menu
:::

### DELETE action

The action can be triggered by selecting it from the sub-menu of an existing entity:

![Delete button marked](../../../static/img/platform-overview/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/delete-action-marked.png)

## Action message structure

Every invocation of an Action publishes a new `run` message (with its own unique `runId` value) to the [runs Kafka topic](./port-execution-topics), we will now explore the structure of an `action run` message:

| Field | Description | Example |
| --- | ---| --- |
| `action` | The action identifier | `Create microservice` |
| `resourceType` | The type of resource that triggered the action, in the case of action runs, always defaults to `run` | `run` |
| `status` | The status of the action, in the case of action runs, always defaults to `TRIGGERED` | `TRIGGERED` |
| `trigger` | Shows audit data for the action run | Example below |
| `context` | An object containing the context of the action, has keys for `blueprint`, `entity` and `runId` | Example below |
| `payload` | Explanation below | Example below |

### Example Trigger

The trigger includes audit data such as: who triggered the action, when and how did he trigger it (`UI` or `API`)

```json showLineNumbers
"trigger": {
    "by": {
        "userId": "auth0|<USER>",
        "orgId": "<ORG>"
    },
    "at": "2022-07-27T17:50:58.776Z",
    "origin": "UI"
}
```

### Example context

```json showLineNumbers
"context": {
    "entity": null,
    "blueprint": "k8sCluster",
    "runId": "r_AtbOjbe45GNDElcQ"
}
```

### Action run payload

The `payload` object contains the data needed to act upon the action, it includes the following keys:

- `entity` - This is the entity the run is executed on (in the case of `DAY-2` or `DELETE`, for `CREATE` it will be `null`)
- `action` - This is the definition of the action that was triggered, it includes all of the action configuration, including the expected `userInputs`, `description`, etc...
- `properties` - This key includes the values provided by the developer when executing the action, the keys in this object match the keys defined under the `userInputs` key in the action definition

Here is an example `payload` object for a `CREATE` action:

```json showLineNumbers
"payload": {
    "entity": null,
    "action": {
        "id": "action_lGviYLG6W5U9o2Qq",
        "identifier": "Create",
        "title": "Create",

                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Title"
                },
                "region": {
                    "type": "string",

                    "enum": [
                        "prod-2-use1"
                    ],
                    "default": "prod-1-use1",
                    "description": "The region that this cluster is going to be deployed"
                },
                "version": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Version"
                },
                "type": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Type",
                    "enum": [
                        "EKS",
                        "Self-Managed"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "region"
            ]
        },
        "invocationMethod": "KAFKA",
        "trigger": "CREATE",
        "description": "This will create a new k8s cluster",
        "blueprint": "k8sCluster",
        "createdAt": "2022-07-27T16:47:23.165Z",
        "createdBy": "auth0|6278b02000955c006f9132d3",
        "updatedAt": "2022-07-27T16:47:23.165Z",
        "updatedBy": "auth0|6278b02000955c006f9132d3"
    },
    "properties": {
        "region": "prod-2-use1",
        "title": "dev-env",
        "version": "1.2",
        "type": "EKS"
    }
}
```
