# Self-Service Actions

In Port, you can activate your Software Catalog by defining self service actions for your developers to perform, without assistance or dependency on DevOps teams.

Port enables developer self-service in 2 distinct ways:

- [Self-Service Actions](./setting-self-service-actions-in-port) - configure **Create** and **Delete** actions to provision and control the resource usage in your organization. Configure **Day-2 Operations** which allow you to keep your infrastructure up-to-date.
- [Real-time Changelog](./changelog-basic-change-listener-using-aws-lambda) - every change that occurs in Port generates a new audit log entry.
