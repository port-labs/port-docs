# Relation

## What is a Relation?

**Relations** enable us to make connections between blueprints. This gives logical context to your software catalog.  

In practice we can use relations to connect between entities of the related blueprints.  

**For example**, to see where your `microservices` are deployed, you need to create a relation between your `microservices` and `deployment` blueprints.

## Relation JSON structure

The basic structure of a Relation schema:

```json showLineNumbers
{
    "identifier": "UniqueId",
    "title": "Title",
    "source": "Blueprint Source Identifier",
    "target": "Blueprint Target Identifier",
    "required": false
}
```

---
## Structure table
| Field | Type | Description | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| `identifier` | `String` | A unique identifier. <br /> **Note that** while the identifier is unique, it can be changed after creation. |
| `title` | `String` | A nicely written name for the relation that will be shown in the UI. |
| `source` | `String` | The source blueprint identifier. |
| `target` | `String` | The target blueprint identifier. |
| `required` | `Boolean` | A boolean flag to define whether the target entity is a must when creating a new source. | 


:::tip
The title allows you to give human-readable names to relations. For example, A `Package` <-> `Deployment` relation can be called  `Used By` to describe the context of the relation to the user.

Using titles also allows you to conveniently access relations programmatically in a generic way while keeping the UI readable.

For example, you can define a convention where all relations are named in a specific format:
- `{blueprint_1}-{blueprint_2}`
- `{blueprint_1}-to-{blueprint_2}`
- `{blueprint_1}<->{blueprint_2}`
- or anything similar that works for you

This will allow you to interact with relations in code in a generic way, without impacting UX.

:::note
When creating a blueprint from the API, there is no need for the `source` field. For more info refer to the [API reference](../api-reference) section.

## Relation example

Please see the following example of a relation between `microservices` and `deployment` blueprint.
Let's say we have those two blueprints defined, and we want to connect between them, in a way that the `deployment` is the `source` and `microservice` is the `target`.  

The JSON schema of the relation is as follows:
```json showLineNumbers
{
    "identifier": "deployment-2-microservice",
    "title": "Deployement Of",
    "source": "deployment",
    "target": "microservice",
    "required": false
}
```

Resulting in this outcome in the UI:

:::info
Our `source` to `target` relations are one-to-many, at the moment. Meaning that the `target` blueprint can have many entities of the `source` blueprint.  
For example, a `deployment -> microservices` relation means that a `microservice` can be deployed many times, while a `deployment` represents a single `microservice`.

:::note
We will support many-to-many relations soon!

## Byproducts of a relation


### Relation object for entities

When two blueprints are related, creating an entity of the `source` blueprint will show an additional option - a `relation`.  
This will add a property under the `relations` section, as shown in the [relations section.](./entity#related-entities)

### Mirror properties

Creating a relation between multiple blueprints allows you to use **Mirror Properties** to enrich the data attached to your entities by querying additional data from related entities with fewer steps.

You can learn more about these properties in the [Mirror Properties](./mirror-properties) page.
