### Auto importable properties

| Field | Description 
| ----------- | ----------- |

| `mainLanguage` | The main language the repo is written in `Typescript`, `Python`, etc... |
| `openIssues` | The number of the open issues for the repository |
| `commitMessage` | The latest commit message of the repoistory <br/><br/> * When there are multiple `port.yml` files the commit message will be taken from each `port.yml` file's parent directory | 
| `commitedBy` | Who performed the latest commit (Author username) <br/><br/> * When there are multiple `port.yml` files the commited by will be determined by who did the last commit to each `port.yml` file's parent directory |
| `commitHash` | The latest commit hash of the repoistory <br/><br/> * When there are multiple `port.yml` files the commit hash will be taken from each `port.yml` file's parent directory |

| `archived` | Is the repository archived? |


### Using auto importable properties

In order to use auto importable properties all you have to do is add the JSON below to your [blueprint schema](../../platform-overview/port-components/blueprint.md#blueprints-properties), if you still don't have a blueprint with GitHub integration please refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart) to create one.

:::tip:
You can choose to include just a subset of the auto importable properties shown above, or all of them
