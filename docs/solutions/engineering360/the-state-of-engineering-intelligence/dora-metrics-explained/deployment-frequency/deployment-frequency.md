# Deployment Frequency

**Definition**: How often an organization successfully deploys code to production or releases to end-users. Typically measured as deployments per day, week, or month. Higher frequency means smaller, more frequent releases. 

**What it tells you**: Deployment Frequency is a proxy for how quickly value is flowing to customers. Elite performers might deploy on-demand or multiple times a day, indicating a very efficient CI/CD pipeline and culture of continuous delivery. A high DF often correlates with smaller batch sizes, which reduces risk and makes troubleshooting easier (because changesets are small). 

**What it misses or risks**: DF alone doesn’t account for stability or quality. It’s possible to deploy frequently but with many failures or bugs. Teams could also game DF by deploying trivial changes or toggling features on/off just to count a “deployment.” If measured without a clear definition, teams might count different things (merges to main vs. actual production deploys). Over-focusing on DF can lead to neglecting quality – e.g. pushing unfinished code just to increase count. 

**Common misinterpretations**: Low deployment frequency isn’t always bad – it may be a deliberate choice for certain industries (e.g., aerospace or medical software might deploy less due to heavy validation needs). It’s important to compare DF in context: if your releases are monthly because of business cadence, that might be fine, but if it’s monthly because your process is painfully manual, that’s an issue. Also, an uptick in DF accompanied by rising incident rates could signal rushing. 

**Improvement strategies**:
- Trunk-based development & small batches: Encourage small, frequent merges to main and use feature flags. This way, code is always in a deployable state.
- Address bottlenecks: If analysis shows code sits waiting for review or testing, invest in those areas (e.g., add reviewers or speed up tests).
- Infrastructure as Code & Immutable infra: These practices make deployments more reliable, which in turn gives confidence to deploy more often
- Set a goal and measure trend: For example, “increase DF from bi-weekly to weekly within next quarter” and track progress.
