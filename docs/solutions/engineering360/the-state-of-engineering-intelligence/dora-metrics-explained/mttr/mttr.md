# Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)

**Definition**: When a production incident or failure occurs, MTTR measures how long on average it takes to restore service. Essentially, from the start of an outage (or degradation) to full recovery. Often measured in hours or minutes. Shorter MTTR means you can bounce back quickly. 

**What it tells you**: MTTR is a key operational resilience metric. It indicates the effectiveness of your incident response process – monitoring, alerting, on-call efficiency, and the simplicity or redundancy of your systems. A low MTTR means even if failures happen (and some will, inevitably), the impact on users is minimized by swift recovery. It reflects well on DevOps practices like automation in incident management and good disaster recovery planning.

**What it misses or risks**: MTTR can be tricky to measure consistently – what if an incident is partially resolved, or temporarily fixed and then reoccurs? Do you count time to temporary mitigation or full resolution? Organizations define this differently. Also, MTTR doesn’t reflect the frequency of incidents; a team might have few incidents but each takes a day to resolve vs. another with many small incidents resolved in minutes. MTTR by itself doesn’t tell you how reliable the system is, just how quickly you fix issues. Additionally, similar to CFR, teams could game MTTR by focusing on quick fixes that might not be thorough (thus perhaps causing new issues later), or by redefining "recovery" loosely.

**Common misinterpretations**: Sometimes MTTR is taken as a personal metric (“how fast individual X resolves issues”). It should really be about the system and team process, not individuals. Comparing MTTR across teams can be unfair if their incident types differ widely (e.g., a database incident vs. a minor UI bug; the latter “recovers” faster by nature). Also, extremely low MTTR might imply you’re really good at firefighting – which is great, but it might also hide that you’re having to firefight a lot. Always pair MTTR with CFR and incident frequency to get a full picture of stability. 

**Improvement strategies**:
- Strong monitoring and alerts: The faster you detect an issue, the faster you can resolve it. Invest in APM tools, uptime monitors, error alerting. Reduce mean time to detect, which is a subset of MTTR.
- On-call practices: Ensure a responsive on-call rotation. This includes proper training, accessible runbooks, and perhaps lightweight on-call tooling (like one-click access to dashboards or predefined queries).
- Automated remediation: Where possible, automate recovery steps. For example, if a server goes down, auto-trigger a replacement (auto-scaling or container restarts). If a known issue occurs, script the fix (like clear queue, restart service X).
- Runbooks and Knowledge Base: Document common failure scenarios with step-by-step guides. In the heat of an incident, having a playbook saves precious time. New engineers on call especially benefit from this.
- Chaos Engineering: It might sound counterintuitive, but intentionally injecting failures in non-prod (or even prod carefully) can train the team and harden systems to recover quickly. By practicing failure scenarios (like disaster recovery drills, game days), you reduce panic and hone your MTTR down.
- Post-incident reviews: After each major incident, do a retro. Did we take too long to find the root cause? Why? Maybe logs were missing or alarms didn’t trigger. Fix those process issues so next time recovery is quicker. For instance, if access to a production environment took 30 minutes to grant during an incident, that’s actionable (maybe automate that as Port suggests with just-in-time access for on-call engineers)
