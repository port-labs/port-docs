# Designing Actionable Surveys

Conducting surveys is only half the battle – the other half is designing them in a way that yields useful, actionable insights. An “actionable” survey means that its questions and structure lead to clear understanding and can inform decisions or changes. Here are best practices and principles for designing surveys that genuinely drive action in the engineering context:

### 1. Start With the End in Mind
Before drafting any question, ask: “*What would I do if I got a certain response?*” For a survey to be actionable, you should have an idea of the potential actions each question could prompt. If you find a question is “nice to know” but you can’t envision acting on any of its possible answers, consider cutting it. For example, asking “*Which programming language do you prefer?*” might be interesting, but unless you plan to change something based on that (like offer training in a popular language, or consider standardizing languages), it might not be actionable. On the other hand, “*How would you rate the ease of our release process?*” is directly tied to something you can improve if ratings are low (e.g., simplify the process, add automation). **Each survey item should connect to a potential improvement area**.


### 2. Use Clear and Specific Questions
Vague or compound questions produce muddled answers. Design questions that target a single aspect clearly. Instead of “Are tools and processes adequate?”, break it down: “Do you have the tools you need to do your job effectively?” and separately “Do our current development processes (e.g. code review, CI) support rapid delivery?”. This way, if you get a negative response, you know whether to look at tools or processes specifically. Avoid double-barreled questions (e.g., “Do you find the onboarding and training helpful?” – a person might find onboarding good but training poor; you won’t know how to act). If needed, add context or examples in the question to ensure everyone interprets it similarly (e.g., “Rate your satisfaction with code reviews (e.g., feedback quality, speed of reviews)”). Clarity leads to actionable specificity – you’ll know exactly what area the feedback is about.


### 3. Keep It Concise
Lengthy surveys with dozens of questions can overwhelm respondents, leading to drop-offs or superficial answers, which in turn reduces actionability. It’s better to have a short survey with high-quality data than a long one full of half-hearted answers. Prioritize questions: identify the “must-haves” vs “nice-to-haves.” In an engineering context, developers appreciate conciseness. Aim for a survey that can be completed in a reasonable time (e.g., 5-10 minutes for a quarterly survey, 1-2 minutes for a pulse). A common technique is to have a core set of questions that remain consistent (to track trends) and a few rotating questions on timely topics (to gather insight on new issues). This keeps surveys focused. Shorter surveys also directly combat fatigue – people are more likely to give thoughtful feedback if they see only a handful of questions.


### 4. Balance Closed and Open-Ended Questions
Closed questions (yes/no, multiple choice, rating scales) are easy to quantify and compare. Open-ended questions (free text) provide richness and context that numbers alone can’t. An actionable survey often uses a mix: closed questions to measure and detect issues, and a few open-ended prompts to capture suggestions or deeper explanations. For example, you might ask “Rate your satisfaction with our documentation (1-5)”, and follow with an open question: “What’s one thing we could do to improve documentation for you?”. The rating tells you if there’s a problem, and the comment tells you what action might help. Be careful not to make the survey too open-ended – developers are busy, and writing long responses takes time. Use open questions sparingly for key areas. Also, when analyzing, treat open responses seriously: categorize them, look for common themes, and highlight representative quotes when presenting findings. Often the qualitative insights are what really drive action, because they tell stories that pure numbers cannot.


### 5. Plan for Results Communication and Follow-up
When designing, think about how results will be reported and what follow-up discussions might look like. If you create a survey full of highly technical questions that only the platform team will understand, how will you communicate those results to a broader audience or leadership? It might be fine if that’s your target, but often you’ll share a summary with the whole engineering org. So, phrase questions in a way that you’d be comfortable having the aggregated responses up on a slide. Also, design questions to facilitate year-over-year or iteration-over-iteration comparison. If you intend to run the survey again, keeping some questions consistent allows trending (e.g., “Developer satisfaction with dev environment: 3.5 this quarter vs 3.0 last quarter”). Trendable metrics are actionable in that they show if changes you made had effect.


### Turning developer feedback into real action
By following these guidelines, you’ll craft surveys that yield clear, meaningful insights. An actionable survey yields responses like “X% of devs are dissatisfied with Y” or “Top frustration is Z”, which you can directly feed into your engineering roadmap or retrospectives. It moves the conversation from anecdotal “I feel” to data-driven “The team has spoken, and we need to do something about it.” In Port’s Engineering360, we’ve baked in these best practices .Remember, a well-designed survey is not just a diagnostic tool but a catalyst for improvement.
