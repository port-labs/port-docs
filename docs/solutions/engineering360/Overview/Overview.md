### Why Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) Matters

At Port, we recognize that engineering organizations thrive when decisions are grounded in clarity and precision. Software Engineering Intelligence (SEI) offers the visibility needed to transform intuition into insight, empowering teams to optimize software delivery and enhance the developer experience simultaneously.

Engineering360 is Port’s SEI solution, designed to combine objective engineering performance data—such as DORA metrics—with qualitative developer sentiment gathered through targeted surveys. This approach addresses two pivotal questions every engineering leader should consider:

- How effectively is our engineering organization delivering software?
- How satisfied and empowered are our developers in their daily work?

### Why Combine DORA Metrics with Developer Sentiment?
DORA metrics—Deployment Frequency, Lead Time, Change Failure Rate, and Mean Time to Recovery—offer vital data about the health and efficiency of your software delivery processes. However, they only tell part of the story. To genuinely improve performance, you must understand the "why" behind these metrics.

Developer sentiment surveys complement DORA metrics by shedding light on the experiences and challenges your teams face daily. They reveal human factors affecting performance, such as process friction, tooling bottlenecks, or team dynamics that pure data metrics alone cannot capture.

For example, if deployment frequency declines and surveys simultaneously indicate widespread frustration with unreliable CI/CD pipelines, you can directly correlate these insights to identify and resolve the underlying issues causing these disruptions.

Engineering360 bridges these perspectives, enabling engineering leaders to:
- Identify not just what is happening, but why.
- Take proactive, targeted actions based on reliable data.
- Improve developer satisfaction, directly enhancing productivity, retention, and engagement.

### From Insight to Action—All Within Your Internal Developer Portal

While numerous tools exist for measuring engineering health, from dashboards to developer analytics platforms, Port aims to go further. With Engineering360, insights are transformed into actions within your internal developer portal.

By integrating DORA metrics and developer sentiment directly into your portal, Engineering360 allows you to:

#### 1. Discover your team’s blockers   
Use a combination of engineering metrics and developer feedback to uncover friction points that are slowing your teams down.
#### 2. Focus on the biggest bottleneck   
Prioritize the most impactful blockers by correlating quantitative data with real survey responses, ensuring your efforts target what matters most.
#### 3. Clear them inside Port   
Resolve bottlenecks directly within your portal using Port’s automations, self-service actions, or custom workflows—making it easy to drive meaningful change as part of everyday work.
#### 4. Show your velocity gains   
Track and communicate improvements in delivery metrics and developer satisfaction with out-of-the-box dashboards, proving ROI and motivating further progress.

This approach ensures that improvements are not only identified but also implemented effectively, enhancing both visibility and velocity.

For instance, consider a scenario where deployment frequency declines—a key DORA metric indicating potential issues in the delivery pipeline. Simultaneously, developer surveys reveal growing frustration with flaky CI/CD pipelines. Engineering360 correlates these insights, pinpointing the unreliable pipelines as the root cause. Within the internal developer portal, teams can access self-service actions to rerun failed pipelines or retrieve logs, while automated alerts notify the DevOps team when pipeline failures exceed a certain threshold, prompting immediate investigation.

In another case, an increase in lead time for changes is observed, coupled with developer feedback highlighting delays in code reviews. Engineering360 identifies this bottleneck and facilitates a solution through the portal by introducing a dashboard displaying pending pull requests and their statuses. Automated reminders are sent to reviewers for PRs exceeding a set timeframe, ensuring timely code reviews and reducing lead times.

By unifying insights and actions, Engineering360 empowers teams to move beyond reactive problem-solving towards proactive improvement, ensuring that developer experience and software delivery performance continually evolve in tandem.

### Who Benefits from Engineering360?
