# PagerDuty Integration for DORA Metrics

Port offers a straightforward, self-service approach to track DORA metrics from your PagerDuty incidents. You can quickly define what counts as an “incident” for your organization using out-of-the-box action in the portal, all directly in the portal UI without any manual configuration needed.

### Prerequisites
- An installed PagerDuty integration.
- An installed DORA Metrics experience.
- Admin permissions in Port to modify integrations and mappings.

### How Incident Tracking Works

With Port’s PagerDuty integration, all incidents from your connected PagerDuty account are ingested automatically. There’s no need to define custom filters or mapping rules—Port will bring in every PagerDuty incident as part of your DORA metrics dashboard.

### How to Configure
1. Go to the “2. Set up your incidents” configuration page in your Port portal.

2. Locate the “Configure your incident method” section.

3. Select the self-service action to enable PagerDuty incident tracking.

4. Execute the action.

That’s it—Port will now automatically ingest all PagerDuty incidents and reflect them in your DORA dashboards.

### Customization and Advanced Mapping

If your incident workflow is more nuanced, you can further refine what counts as an incident by tweaking the integration mapping directly or combining multiple mapping blocks.

For full control, you can go directly to the mapping of your PagerDuty integration and manually adjust it. This allows you to add or modify relations to specific services and teams, or create more granular filters (e.g., by severity, owning team, or tags). With this setup, you can analyze your DORA metrics by team or service, making it easier to identify bottlenecks, compare incident response performance, and generate actionable insights.

### Next Steps

You can continue refining your incident integration as your workflows evolve, or explore guides for integrating other tools to build a holistic view of your software delivery process.

With your PagerDuty integration set up, you now have instant visibility into how incidents impact your DORA metrics, empowering your teams to drive operational improvements.
