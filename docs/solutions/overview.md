# Solutions overview

Software has eaten the world. Across industries, markets and segments, many companies are now software engineering organizations, building and operating software to bring more value to customers, faster, more securely and at a lower operating cost.

Port's suite of solutions is designed to address the critical challenges faced by developers, platform engineers, engineering managers, security engineers, SREs, and FinOps specialists.
We provide the tools and insights necessary to streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, enforce standards, and gain deep visibility across your entire software delivery lifecycle.

## Port's philosophy

While the needs of many teams are similar, modern software development is complex, with fragmented tool chains and practices. Port's goal is to provide:

1. A platform flexible enough to accommodate every tool and team within your organization, from latest reference architecture to oldest legacy service.
2. A set of opinionated, best-practice solutions to guide your teams through their quest to modernize and improve development practices.


## Solution principles

- **Unlock collaboration**: By leveraging Port's rich RBAC and no-code UI personalization - multiple personas can collaborate on different shared problems, whether it's requesting and reviewing security ignores or implementing rightsizing recommendations to reduce operating costs.
- **Empower engineers**: By providing self-service capabilities and intelligent automation, we free up valuable engineering time, allowing teams to focus on innovation rather than operational overhead.
- **Enhance visibility & control**: We aggregate data from disparate systems to provide comprehensive, real-time insights into your software catalog, and posture across security, costs, reliability and other areas of focus. We believe that engineering leaders should have data to help drive decisions and measure ROI.
- **Establish and raise standards**: Once measuring metrics across all your teams and their disparate stacks, it is finally possible to establish and continuously improve standards across all the non-functional aspects of software development.

Solutions embed these standards directly into your existing workflows, making compliance a natural part of the development process.
