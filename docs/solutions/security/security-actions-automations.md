# Security actions & automations

Manual security processes don't scale. Every day, security teams face an overwhelming stream of alerts, vulnerability reports, compliance exceptions, and incident escalations. Meanwhile, developers wait for approvals, security reviews, and guidance on issues they could resolve themselves if given the right context and tools.

The traditional model—where every security decision must flow through a central security team—creates bottlenecks that slow development while paradoxically making organizations less secure. When security processes are friction-heavy and opaque, teams find workarounds that bypass security entirely.

## Why manual security processes create risk

Manual security processes seem safer on the surface, but they often create more risk than they prevent:

- **Delayed response times**: Critical vulnerabilities wait in queues while analysts work through backlogs
- **Inconsistent decision-making**: Different analysts make different calls on similar issues
- **Context loss**: By the time security reviews happen, the original context is often lost
- **Shadow IT emergence**: Teams bypass slow security processes by using unauthorized tools and services
- **Analyst burnout**: Security professionals spend time on routine tasks instead of strategic threat hunting

## Intelligent security automations

Port transforms security from a manual bottleneck into an intelligent automation layer that accelerates secure development while maintaining appropriate oversight. Here's how:

### Automated vulnerability triage

Not every vulnerability deserves human attention. Intelligent triage routes issues based on business context:

#### Smart vulnerability routing
- **Critical business services**: High-severity vulnerabilities in customer-facing services → immediate escalation to security team
- **Internal tools**: Medium-severity findings in development tooling → standard team queue with 7-day SLA
- **Deprecated services**: All vulnerabilities in services marked for decommissioning → batch review during maintenance windows

#### Context-enriched alerts
Instead of raw scanner output, security teams receive actionable intelligence:
- Service ownership and contact information
- Business criticality and customer impact assessment  
- Recent changes that might have introduced vulnerabilities
- Similar vulnerabilities previously found and how they were resolved

### Self-service security exception handling

Enable teams to handle routine security exceptions without waiting for approvals:

#### Risk-based auto-approval
- **Low-risk exceptions**: Development environment vulnerabilities in non-sensitive applications → automatic approval with 30-day expiration
- **Medium-risk exceptions**: Staging environment issues with documented compensating controls → automatic approval with security team notification
- **High-risk exceptions**: Production vulnerabilities in customer-facing services → require security team review and approval

#### Transparent exception tracking
Every exception is logged with business justification and automatic expiration:
- Clear documentation of risk acceptance reasoning
- Automatic notifications when exceptions are approaching expiration
- Audit trails for compliance and security review processes
- Trend analysis to identify systematic security debt

### Intelligent escalation workflows

Ensure critical security issues get the right attention without overwhelming security teams:

#### Escalation triggers
Smart escalation based on business context and time sensitivity:
- **Immediate escalation**: Critical vulnerabilities in production services with known exploits
- **Business hours escalation**: High-severity findings in customer-facing services during normal business hours
- **Scheduled escalation**: Medium-severity issues that haven't been addressed within SLA timeframes

#### Contextual notifications
Send escalations to the right people with the right information:
- **Security team**: Technical details, exploit availability, affected service architecture
- **Engineering managers**: Business impact, resource requirements, timeline expectations
- **Business stakeholders**: Customer impact, regulatory implications, competitive risks

Automate the 80% of routine security decisions so your security team can focus on the 20% that require human expertise and judgment.

## Putting security automations into practice

### Vulnerability management automation

Streamline the vulnerability management lifecycle from detection to remediation:

#### Automated vulnerability processing
- [Create Jira issues from Dependabot alerts](/guides/all/create-jira-issue-from-dependabot/) with full context and ownership information
- [Automatically escalate Snyk vulnerabilities](/guides/all/create-jira-issue-from-snyk-vulnerability/) based on business criticality and exploit availability
- Route vulnerabilities to appropriate teams based on service ownership and technology stack

#### Intelligent vulnerability enrichment
- [Enrich security vulnerabilities using AI](/guides/all/enrich-security-vulnerability-using-ai/) to provide context and remediation guidance
- Automatically research exploit availability and attack complexity
- Correlate vulnerabilities with recent code changes and deployment history
- Provide automated impact assessment based on service architecture

### Automated compliance and standards enforcement

Reduce manual compliance checks through intelligent automation:

#### Proactive compliance monitoring
- [Enforce branch protection rules](/guides/all/setup-branch-protection-rules/) across all repositories automatically
- [Track GitLab project security maturity](/guides/all/track-gitlab-project-maturity-with-scorecards/) with automated scoring and improvement recommendations
- Monitor security configurations and alert on drift from established baselines

#### Self-healing security configurations
- Automatically remediate common security misconfigurations
- Restore security settings when they're accidentally disabled
- Apply security patches during maintenance windows with appropriate testing

### Incident response automation

Accelerate security incident response through intelligent automation:

#### Automated incident correlation
- Correlate security alerts with service dependencies and recent changes
- Automatically create incident response channels with relevant stakeholders
- Provide responders with contextual information including architecture diagrams, ownership details, and recent deployment history

#### Response workflow automation
- Automatically notify relevant teams based on service ownership and escalation policies
- Create placeholder incident reports with known information to accelerate documentation
- Integrate with existing incident management tools to maintain workflow consistency

## Advanced security automation patterns

### AI-powered security intelligence

Leverage AI to augment human security decision-making:

#### Intelligent threat analysis
- Analyze vulnerability patterns to identify systematic security weaknesses
- Predict which services are most likely to have security issues based on historical data
- Provide personalized security recommendations based on technology stack and risk profile

#### Automated security testing
- Trigger security scans based on code changes and deployment patterns
- Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines with intelligent fail/pass decisions
- Generate security test cases based on application architecture and attack patterns

### Dynamic risk assessment

Adjust security controls based on real-time risk assessment:

#### Context-aware access controls
- Modify security review requirements based on service criticality and change risk
- Automatically adjust approval workflows during high-risk periods (pre-holiday deployments, post-incident changes)
- Implement dynamic security policies based on threat intelligence and organizational risk tolerance

#### Risk-based automation thresholds
- Increase automation approval limits for teams with strong security track records
- Require additional human oversight for services with recent security incidents
- Adjust security scanning frequency based on service activity and risk profile

:::caution Balance speed with governance
While automation can dramatically improve efficiency, ensure you maintain appropriate audit trails and override capabilities for edge cases that require human judgment.
