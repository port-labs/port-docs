:::tip Unify security strategy and execution
**From prioritizing vulnerabilities to visualizing progress, Port unifies security strategy and execution in one powerful platform.**
:::

## Executive summary

Most security dashboards today are filled with **vanity metrics**—impressive to look at, but meaningless for driving action.  
Executives see:
- Raw vulnerability counts without business context,
- Generic compliance percentages,
- Inflated attack numbers from bots and scanners.

These metrics create **false confidence** and fail to answer the questions that truly matter:
- Are we getting more secure over time?
- Which areas deserve our immediate attention?
- How much business risk are we carrying today?
- Where should we invest resources for maximum impact?

Port solves this by enabling **business-context-driven security metrics** and flexible visualizations.  
With Port, you can create dashboards that connect vulnerabilities, services, teams, and business risk—turning scattered technical data into **strategic security intelligence**.

## Why traditional security metrics miss the mark

Traditional metrics focus on raw counts, not outcomes:
- *“We have 15,847 vulnerabilities”* – But which ones matter?
- *“We’re 87% compliant”* – Does that reduce actual risk?
- *“We blocked 2.3 million attacks this month”* – How many were real threats?

These metrics fail because they don’t provide:
- **Context** – Which services or customers are affected?
- **Actionability** – Who should fix the problem and by when?
- **Business relevance** – What’s the potential revenue or compliance impact?

## Align metrics with Port's business-context model

Using Port, you can design metrics that map to the same **business-first approach** as vulnerability prioritization.  
Every metric can be tied to:
- **Services** → Criticality, environment, dependencies.
- **Teams** → Ownership, capacity, training adoption.
- **Vulnerabilities** → Severity, exploitability, business impact.
- **Compliance scope** → SOX, PCI, HIPAA, GDPR.
- **Customer impact** → Which customer tiers or SLAs are affected.

This alignment ensures **metrics and dashboards are directly actionable**, not just observational.

## CISO dashboards with metrics that matter

Security leaders need dashboards that **tell a story** about progress and risk.  
Port enables this with **flexible visualizations**, linking data sources to executive-friendly KPIs.

### 1. Business risk metrics

These metrics focus on *business impact*, not just technical severity:

| Metric | Why It Matters | Example Port Implementation |
|---------|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Critical service exposure** | Identify high-risk production services with exploitable vulnerabilities | Dashboard showing open critical vulnerabilities by production service blueprint |
| **Mean time to remediation (MTTR)** by criticality | Measure how quickly issues are fixed where it matters most | SLA tracking dashboards connected to Jira via Port automations |
| **Risk-adjusted vulnerability trends** | Track whether overall risk is increasing or decreasing | Line chart showing risk score trends over time by service criticality |
| **Compliance gap analysis** | Understand gaps that affect revenue or compliance requirements | Scorecard tracking services mapped to regulatory frameworks |

### 2. Security Culture and Adoption Metrics

Security is a cultural challenge as much as a technical one:

| Metric | Purpose | Example Port Feature |
|--------|---------|-----------------------|
| **Security training completion rates** by role | Track developer readiness | Service owner metadata + scorecards |
| **Scorecard adoption** | Gauge how many teams actively improve posture | Scorecard completion tracking across teams |
| **Time to complete security reviews** | Measure SDLC integration of security | Relations between services and review actions |
| **Security champion engagement** | Monitor champion program health | Blueprint for champions tied to team entities |

### 3. Operational efficiency metrics

Showcase security team performance and tool effectiveness:

| Metric | Purpose | Port Implementation |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Alert triage efficiency** | Measure wasted effort on non-actionable alerts | Dashboard of alerts → resolved vs ignored |
| **False positive rates by tool** | Identify underperforming tools | Table comparing scanner findings vs verified issues |
| **Incident detection & response time** | Track how quickly incidents are resolved | SLA tracking via actions + incident blueprint |
| **Automated remediation success rates** | Prove automation ROI | Trend chart of automation success vs manual fixes |

:::tip Focus on trends, not snapshots
Single-point metrics can mislead.  
Port dashboards allow you to **visualize trends over time**, showing whether posture is improving, stable, or declining.

## Adding context to every metric

Metrics are only meaningful when paired with context.  
Port makes this simple by linking metrics to entities, relationships, and properties in your software catalog.

### 1. Benchmarking and comparisons
- **Industry benchmarks** – Compare your performance to peers.
- **Historical trends** – Track improvements over time.
- **Peer comparisons** – Compare different teams or business units.
- **Goal tracking** – Map progress against organizational targets.

### 2. Business impact context
- **Revenue at risk** – Link vulnerabilities to customer-facing services.
- **Customer impact** – Show which customer tiers are affected.
- **Regulatory exposure** – Highlight compliance-sensitive services.
- **Cost to fix** – Estimate resource needs for remediation.

### 3. Actionability indicators
- **Clear ownership** – Port automatically routes issues to the right team.
- **Remediation timelines** – Track SLA adherence at the service level.
- **Resource dependencies** – Understand what’s needed to close gaps.
- **Success criteria** – Define thresholds for “secure enough” states.

## Port dashboards for different audiences

Port dashboards can be tailored for multiple audiences, each consuming the same core data differently.

### Executive dashboards
High-level view of business risk and compliance:
- [Visualize Wiz vulnerabilities](/guides/all/visualize-your-wiz-vulnerabilities/) with service context.
- [Track AWS storage configurations](/guides/all/visualize-your-aws-storage-configuration/).
- [Monitor GitHub IAM and repository security](/guides/all/visualize-your-github-identity-and-access-management/).

### Operational dashboards
Detailed views for security teams managing workflows:
- [GitHub Dependabot alerts](/guides/all/visualize-your-github-dependabot-alerts/) with triage status.
- SLA tracking dashboards tied to vulnerability blueprints.
- False positive rate tracking per tool.

### Team-specific dashboards
Helping development teams understand their own posture:
- Scorecards for compliance and secure development practices.
- Training completion metrics linked to team entities.
- Vulnerability introduction vs remediation trends by repo.

## Building a security metrics program with Port

### Phase 1: establish baseline metrics
Start with metrics every organization needs:
- Open critical vulnerabilities by production service.
- MTTR by severity and service criticality.
- Security training completion rates.
- Mean time to detect/respond to incidents.

### Phase 2: add business context
Enrich metrics with Port relationships and properties:
- Link vulnerabilities to revenue impact and compliance frameworks.
- Scorecards showing secure-by-default service adoption.
- Dashboards tracking culture metrics alongside risk metrics.

### Phase 3: predict and prevent
Move toward predictive capabilities:
- Forecast vulnerability trends based on recent changes.
- Identify services at risk of future compliance gaps.
- Automated alerts when risk scores exceed defined thresholds.

## Success indicators for your metrics program

You’ll know your program is working when:
- **Executives ask informed questions** about risk, not raw counts.
- **Security teams spend less time generating reports** and more time improving posture.
- **Developers proactively fix vulnerabilities** without security hand-holding.
- **Boards can measure ROI** on security investments with shared dashboards.

## Alignment with vulnerability prioritization

This metrics program directly complements the **vulnerability prioritization** approach:
- Metrics are built from the **same entities and relationships** used to prioritize vulnerabilities.
- Scorecards track **progress over time**, showing if prioritization efforts are working.
- Dashboards bridge **strategic and operational views**, using the same data pipelines.

By connecting metrics and prioritization in one platform, Port eliminates silos and provides a **single source of truth** for security performance.

## Summary

Port enables you to **move beyond vanity metrics** and create security dashboards that:
- Connect vulnerability data to business impact.
- Show trends, not just snapshots.
- Align executives, security teams, and developers around shared goals.
- Drive measurable, continuous improvement.
