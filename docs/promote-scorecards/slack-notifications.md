# Slack Notifications

The portal contains valuable data about standards and compliance (in the form of scorecards or initiatives) about software catalog entities, such as the production readiness (scorecard) of a microservice (an entity).

The [Port slack sender](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/port-message-sender) will allow you to automatically send reports and reminders with regard to initiatives or scorecards, letting managers and developers know what standards need to be met that are relevant to them.
