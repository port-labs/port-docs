### Ownership scorecard

The following example demonstrates an ownership scorecard.

It has one filter defined:

- Only evaluate entities that are related to production (indicated by checking that the `is_production` property is set to `true`).

It has two rules:

- Check that a defined on-call exists and that the number of `open_incidents` is lower than 5;
- Check if a team exists.

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "title": "Ownership",
    "identifier": "ownership",
    "filter": {
      "combinator": "and",
      "conditions": [
        {
          "property": "is_production",
          "operator": "=",
          "value": true
        }
      ]
    },
    "rules": [
      {
        "title": "Has on call?",
        "identifier": "has_on_call",
        "level": "Gold",
        "query": {
          "combinator": "and",
          "conditions": [
            {
              "operator": "isNotEmpty",
              "property": "on_call"
            },
            {
              "operator": "<",
              "property": "open_incidents",
              "value": 5
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "title": "Has a team?",
        "identifier": "has_team",
        "level": "Silver",
        "query": {
          "combinator": "and",
          "conditions": [
            {
              "operator": "isNotEmpty",
              "property": "$team"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Ensure relation existence

Say we have a `service` blueprint that has a relation to another blueprint named `domain`.  
We can define a scorecard that checks that all of our services have a related domain. Services with empty `domain` relations will fail this check:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "title": "Domain definition",
  "identifier": "domain_definition",
  "rules": [
    {
      "identifier": "hasDomain",
      "title": "Has domain",
      "level": "Bronze",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": "isNotEmpty",
            "relation": "domain"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### DORA metrics based on number of deployments

To assess the deployment frequency of a `service`, simply checking the `deployment` relation is not enough â€” we need to know the exact number of deployments. To achieve this, we can:

- Add an [aggregation property](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/aggregation-property.md) to the `service` blueprtint that counts the number of related `deployment` entities.
- Add a scorecard with a rule based on the new aggregation property:

```json showLineNumbers
{ 
  "title": "DORA Metrics",
  "identifier": "dora_metrics",
  "rules": [
    {
      "identifier": "deployFreqBronze",
      "title": "Deployment frequency > 2",
      "level": "Bronze",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": ">",
            "property": "deployment_frequency",
            "value": 3
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "identifier": "deployFreqSilver",
      "title": "Deployment frequency > 4",
      "level": "Silver",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": ">",
            "property": "deployment_frequency",
            "value": 4
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
