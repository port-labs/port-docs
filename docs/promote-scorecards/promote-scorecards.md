# 📊 Promote Scorecards

## What is a Scorecard?

**Scorecards** enable us to create a set of rules that will determine the level of our Port entities, based on their properties.
Each scorecard has a set of rules that affects its total level, a rule has a `level` property which is one of the following: `Gold`, `Silver` or `Bronze`. Each rule has specific conditions, and the scorecard level increases when they pass.

**For example**, to keep track of your organization's `Services` maturity, we can create a set of scorecards on top of a `Service` [blueprint](../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md) that will keep track of their progress.

## 💡 Scorecard use cases

Scorecards can be used to evaluate the maturity, producton readiness and engineering quality of any entity in your software catalog, for example:

- Does a service has an on-call defined?
- Does a README.md file exist in the repository?
- Is Grafana defined for the K8s cluster?
- etc.

In this [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/serviceEntity?identifier=load-generator&activeTab=8) example, you can see the scorecards defined on a service and their evaluation. 🎬

## Scorecard structure table

A single scorecard defines a category to group different checks, validations and evaluations. Here is the structure of a single scorecard:

| Field        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`      | `String` | Scorecard name that will be shown in the UI                                                                                                         |
| `identifier` | `String` | The unique identifier of the `Scorecard`. The identifier is used for API calls, programmatic access and distinguishing between different scorecards |
| `filter`     | `Object` | Optional set of conditions to filter entities that will be evaluated by the scorecard                                                               |
| `rules`      | `Object` | The rules that we create for each scorecard to determine it's level                                                                                 |

A scorecard contains and groups multiple rules that are relevant to its specific category, for example a scorecard for _service maturity_ can contain 3 rules, while the _production readiness_ scorecard can contain 2 completely different rules.

## Filter and rule elements

Filters and rules enable you to generate checks inside a scorecard only for the entities and properties that you really care about.

Both filters and rules follow the same querying structure, but since rules are actual checks to evaluate the entity against, they contain a few more fields to make them distinguishable and human-readable.

<Tabs groupId="filters-and-rules" defaultValue="rules" values={[
{label: "Rules", value: "rules"},
{label: "Filters", value: "filter"}
]}>

<TabItem value="rules">

A scorecard rule is a single evaluation consisting of multiple checks, each rule has a level which directly translates to how important it is for the check to pass (the more basic the check, the lower its level):

| Field        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `title`      | `String` | `Rule` name that will be shown in the UI                                                                                                         |
| `identifier` | `String` | The unique identifier of the `Rule`                                                                                                              |
| `level`      | `String` | one of `Gold` `Silver` `Bronze`                                                                                                                  |
| `query`      | `Object` | The query is built from an array of [`conditions`](#condition-structure-table) and a [`combinator`](#combinator) (or / and) that will define the |

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="filter">

A scorecard filter is used to make sure only relevant entities are evaluated, only entities that the filter evaluates to `true` on will have the specified rule checked:

| Field                                      | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`combinator`](#combinator)                | Defines the logical operation to apply to the query rules |
| [`conditions`](#condition-structure-table) | An array of boolean conditions to filter entities with    |

</TabItem>

### Combinator

<Tabs groupId="combinators" defaultValue="and" values={[
{label: "And", value: "and"},
{label: "Or", value: "or"}
]}>

<TabItem value="and">

```json showLineNumbers

  // highlight-next-line
  "combinator": "and",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "operator": "isNotEmpty",
      "property": "on_call"
    },

      "property": "open_incidents",
      "value": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Conditions

Conditions are small boolean checks that help when determining the final status of a `query` according to the specified [`combinator`](#combinator):

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Scorecard total level calculation

A Scorecard is built from several rules, and each one of them has a `level` property.

The available `Scorecard` levels are

`Basic` -> `Bronze` -> `Silver` -> `Gold`

Once an entity passes all of the rules for a certain level, its level changes accordingly.

:::note basic level
The lowest possible level for rules is `Bronze`. An entity's level will be `Basic` until it has a passed all rules at the `Bronze` level.
:::

## Scorecard example

Please see the following example of an ownership scorecard.

It has one filter:

1. Only evaluate entities that are related to production (indicated by checking that the `is_production` property is set to `true`).

It has two rules:

1. Check that a defined on-call exists and that the number of `open_incidents` is lower than 5;
2. Check if a team exists.

## Scorecard UI indications

After configuring scorecards for the blueprint, entities matching the defined rules and filters will be evaluated and their scorecards will be displayed in the specific entity page:
