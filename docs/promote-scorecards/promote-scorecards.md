# 📊 Promote scorecards

## What is a Scorecard?

**Scorecards** enable us to define and track metrics/standards for our Port entities, based on their properties.
Each scorecard is comprised of a set of rules, where each rule defines one or more conditions that need to be met. Each rule has a `level` property whose value can be one of the following: `Gold`, `Silver` or `Bronze`. 

**For example**, to keep track of your organization's `Services` maturity, we can create a set of scorecards on top of a `Service` [blueprint](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md) that will keep track of their progress.

## 💡 Scorecard use cases

Scorecards can be used to evaluate the maturity, producton readiness and engineering quality of any entity in your software catalog, for example:

- Does a service has an on-call defined?
- Does a README.md file exist in the repository?
- Is Grafana defined for the K8s cluster?
- Is the relation of a certain entity empty?

In this [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/serviceEntity?identifier=load-generator&activeTab=8) example, you can see the scorecards defined on a service and their evaluation. 🎬

## Scorecard structure table

A single scorecard defines a category to group different checks, validations and evaluations. Here is the structure of a single scorecard:

| Field                        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`                      | `String` | Scorecard name that will be shown in the UI                                                                                                         |
| `identifier`                 | `String` | The unique identifier of the `Scorecard`. The identifier is used for API calls, programmatic access and distinguishing between different scorecards |
| [`filter`](#filter-elements) | `Object` | Optional set of [conditions](#conditions) to filter entities that will be evaluated by the scorecard                                                |
| [`rules`](#rule-elements)    | `Object` | The rules that we create for each scorecard to determine its level                                                                                 |

A scorecard contains and groups multiple rules that are relevant to its specific category, for example a scorecard for _service maturity_ can contain 3 rules, while the _production readiness_ scorecard can contain 2 completely different rules.

## Rule elements

Rules enable you to generate checks inside a scorecard only for entities and properties.

A scorecard rule is a single evaluation consisting of multiple checks, each rule has a level which directly translates to how important it is for the check to pass (the more basic the check, the lower its level):

| Field         | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`       | `String` | `Rule` name that will be shown in the UI                                                                                                                      |
| `description` | `String` | Description that will be shown in the UI when the rule is expanded. Value that contains markdown is also supported and will be displayed in a markdown format |
| `identifier`  | `String` | The unique identifier of the `Rule`                                                                                                                           |
| `level`       | `String` | one of `Gold` `Silver` `Bronze`                                                                                                                               |
| `query`       | `Object` | The query is built from an array of [`conditions`](#conditions) and a [`combinator`](#combinator) (or / and) that will define the                             |

### Combinator

<CombinatorIntro />

<Tabs groupId="combinators" defaultValue="and" values={[
{label: "And", value: "and"},
{label: "Or", value: "or"}
]}>

<TabItem value="and">

```json showLineNumbers
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "combinator": "and",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "operator": "isNotEmpty",
      "property": "on_call"
    },
    {
      "operator": "<",
      "property": "open_incidents",
      "value": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="or">

```json showLineNumbers
{
  // highlight-next-line
  "combinator": "or",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "operator": "isNotEmpty",

      "property": "open_incidents",
      "value": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Conditions

Conditions are small boolean checks that help when determining the final status of a `query` according to the specified [`combinator`](#combinator):

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Scorecard total level calculation

A Scorecard is built from several rules, and each one of them has a `level` property.

The available `Scorecard` levels are:

`Basic` -> `Bronze` -> `Silver` -> `Gold`

An entity **always** starts at the **`Basic`** level.

A **rule's** lowest possible level is `Bronze`.

Once an entity passes all of the rules for a certain level, its level changes accordingly, for example:

1. An entity starts at level `Basic`;
2. It has two rules with level `Bronze`;
3. Once the entity passes those two rules, its level would be `Bronze`;
4. It has four rules with level `Silver`;
5. Once the entity passes those four rules (and the rules from `Bronze` level), its level would be `Silver`;
6. etc.

:::note multiple rules scenario
In the example listed above, let's assume the entity passes just one of the two `Bronze` rules, but it passes all of the `Silver` rules. The `level` of the scorecard will still be `Basic`, because not all `Bronze` rules have been satisfied.
:::

## Filter elements

Filters enable you to apply scorecard checks only for the entities and properties that you really care about.

Filters follow the same querying structure as [rules](#rule-elements).

A scorecard filter is used to make sure only relevant entities are evaluated, only entities that the filter evaluates to `true` on will have the specified rule checked:

| Field                       | Description                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`combinator`](#combinator) | Defines the logical operation to apply to the query rules |
| [`conditions`](#conditions) | An array of boolean conditions to filter entities with    |

## Scorecard UI indications

After configuring scorecards for the blueprint, each entity created from it will have a `Scorecards` tab in its [entity page](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page), detailing the different checks and their results:

![Developer Portal Scorecards Tab](../../static/img/software-catalog/scorecard/tutorial/ScorecardsTab.png)

Additionally, the [catalog page](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/catalog-page) of each blueprint will automatically have a column for each scorecard rule.  
For example, this `service` blueprint has 4 rules configured, and we can see a column for each of them in the catalog:

![catalogPageScorecardColumns](../../static/img/software-catalog/scorecard/catalogPageScorecardColumns.png)

### Customizing views

You can use table operations (sort, edit, group-by, etc.) to create various helpful views of your scorecards.  
For example, here are the scores of all `Services` in an organization grouped by team:

![catalogViewScorecardsByTeam](../../static/img/software-catalog/scorecard/catalogViewScorecardsByTeam.png)

Note that every coloumn (scorecard metric) in the table has an aggregation in the bottom, hover over it to see the compliance of this metric across all entities in the table.

### Rule result summaries

Scorecard rules are automatically added as columns in the relevant catalog page, and each such column is summarized on the bottom.  
For example, these services have some rules defined in their scorecards, and we can see that:

- 100% of `Team Batman's` services have an on-call defined, but only 67% of them have a PR cycle time shorter than 1500 minutes.
- The bottom of the table contains an aggregation of the results of each rule for all services (across all teams). 11 out of 18 services in total have a build success rate that is higher than 70%.
