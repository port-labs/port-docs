### Ownership scorecard

The following example demonstrates an ownership scorecard.

It has one filter defined:

- Only evaluate entities that are related to production (indicated by checking that the `is_production` property is set to `true`).

It has two rules:

- Check that a defined on-call exists and that the number of `open_incidents` is lower than 5;
- Check if a team exists.
