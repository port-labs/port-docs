# Open/close GitHub issues

The [Port message sender](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/port-sender) allows you to automatically create GitHub issues for entities with violated scorecard rules, and close them once the violations are fixed.

## Syncing GitHub issues

For every scorecard level that is not completed, a GitHub Issue will be created, along with tasks for the level rules.

Head to the Port sender [GitHub section](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/port-sender#manage-scorecards-with-github-issues) to learn more about the integration and how to use it.
