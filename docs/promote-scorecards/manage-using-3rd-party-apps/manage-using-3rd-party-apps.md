# Manage using 3rd-party apps

Your developer portal contains valuable data about your entities, including their compliance with your standards (using scorecards or initiatives). For example, you can easily determine the production readiness (scorecard) of a microservice (an entity).

Port offers integrations with popular tools that enable you to easily track and manage initiatives and scorecards:

- [JIRA](/promote-scorecards/manage-using-3rd-party-apps/jira) - automatically create Jira issues for violated scorecard rules, and close them once fixed.
- [GitHub](/promote-scorecards/manage-using-3rd-party-apps/github) - automatically create issues for violated scorecard rules, and close them once fixed.
- [Slack](/promote-scorecards/manage-using-3rd-party-apps/slack) - send reports and reminders to relevant personas.
