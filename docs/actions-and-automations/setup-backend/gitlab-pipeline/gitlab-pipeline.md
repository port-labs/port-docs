# GitLab Pipelines Actions

Port's GitLab Pipeline Action can trigger a [GitLab Pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/) using a customer provided input and [`port_payload`](/actions-and-automations/reflect-action-progress/#action-run-json-structure), for both self-service actions and automations.

The steps shown in the image above are as follows:

1. Port publishes an invoked `Action` message containing the pipeline details to a topic;
2. A secure topic (`ORG_ID.runs`) holds all the action invocations;
3. Port's execution agent pulls the new trigger event from your Kafka topic, and triggers your GitLab Pipeline.
