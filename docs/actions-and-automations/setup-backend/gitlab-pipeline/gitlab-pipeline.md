# GitLab pipeline

The GitLab backend allows you to trigger GitLab pipelines for your self-service actions and automations. 

## SaaS vs. self-hosted

Depending on your GitLab setup, it is recommended to use a different method to trigger your pipelines.

- For [**GitLab SaaS**](/actions-and-automations/setup-backend/gitlab-pipeline/saas), the webhook backend is a convenient choice.
- For [**GitLab self-hosted**](/actions-and-automations/setup-backend/gitlab-pipeline/self-hosted), the Port execution agent is the preferred method.
