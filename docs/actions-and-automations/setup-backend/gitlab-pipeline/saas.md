# GitLab SaaS

If you use the cloud (SaaS) version of GitLab in your organization, the simplest way to trigger your pipelines from Port is to use the [webhook backend](/actions-and-automations/setup-backend/webhook/).  

GitLab allows you to create webhooks URLs that can be triggered from external services, such as Port, causing a pipeline to run in your GitLab project.

## Configure the backend

Choose `Trigger Webhook URL` as the backend type when creating a new self-service action or automation.  

When using the webhook backend, you need to configure several parameters:

<br/><br/>

- Since we are using GitLab SaaS, the `Use self-hosted agent` option should be set to `No`.
- Read about the `Request type` in the [webhook backend](/actions-and-automations/setup-backend/webhook/#request-type---sync-vs-async) page.
- The `Method` field should be set to `POST`.
- The `Endpoint URL` field should be filled with the webhook URL you create in GitLab (see below).

:::tip Create action/automation via API
If you wish to create a self-service action or automation via [Port's API](https://docs.getport.io/api-reference/create-an-action-automation), choose the `webhook` backend type under the `invocationMethod` object.

### Create the webhook URL

A webhook URL used to trigger a pipeline in GitLab looks like this:

```bash
https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/{GITLAB_PROJECT_ID}/ref/main/trigger/pipeline?token={GITLAB_TRIGGER_TOKEN}
```

As you can see, there are two parameters that need to be filled in:

- **`{GITLAB_PROJECT_ID}`** - The ID of the GitLab project containing your pipeline file.  
  To obtain the project ID, navigate to your project in GitLab, click on the `â‹®` button in the top right corner, and select `Copy project ID`.

- **`{GITLAB_TRIGGER_TOKEN}`** - The token used to authenticate the request.  
  
  To create a new trigger token, follow these steps:  
  - Navigate to your GitLab project page.
  - Go to `Settings` -> `CI/CD`.
  - Expand `Pipeline trigger tokens`.
  - Select `Add new token`.
  - Add a description and click `Create pipeline trigger token`.
  
  **Note:** You must have (at least) the `Maintainer` role in the project to create a new trigger token.

### Webhook security

For increased security, you can [validate the webhook signature](/actions-and-automations/setup-backend/webhook/signature-verification/).

### Configure the payload

The payload is the data sent to the webhook URL every time the action/automation is executed. It is defined by the action/automation creator and can include any data that is needed by the GitLab pipeline.

When using the `webhook` backend, the payload is defined under the `headers` and `body` fields.
