# GitHub workflow

The GitHub backend allows you to trigger GitHub workflows for your self-service actions and automations, using [Port's GitHub application](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/#setup).  

:::tip GitHub app types
The GitHub backend is available for both the standard Port [GitHub app](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/github.md), and the [self-hosted version](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/self-hosted-installation.md).

The steps shown in the image above are as follows:

1. Port publishes an invoked `action` message to a topic.
2. A secure topic (`ORG_ID.github.runs`) holds all the action invocations.
3. A listener implemented in Port's GitHub application receives the new topic message and runs the GitHub workflow defined by the creator of the self-service action/automation.

An example flow would be:

1. A developer asks to deploy a new version of an existing `Microservice`, using a self-service action.
2. The `create` action is sent to the `github.runs` topic.
3. Port's GitHub application event handler is triggered by this new action message.
4. Port's GitHub application triggers the GitHub workflow that deploys a new version of the service.
5. As part of the workflow, the new microservice `Deployment` is reported back to Port.
6. When the workflow is done, Port's GitHub application reports back to Port about the status of the action run (`SUCCESS` or `FAILURE`), according to workflow's status.

## Configuration

When using this backend, you need to provide the GitHub organization and repository where the workflow is located, as well as the workflow name.  
The workflow must reside in the repository's `.github/workflows/` directory.

### Specify a branch

By default, the integration will look for the workflow in the `main` branch of the repository.  

To use a different branch, simply pass the `ref` key in the `Configure the invocation payload` section (or `invocationMethod.workflowInputs` in the JSON object) with the desired branch name as the value:

```json
{
  "ref": "my-branch-name"
}
```

### Automatic workflow status update

Additionally, you can define whether or not Port should automatically use the workflow's end status (`SUCCESS`/`FAILURE`) to update the action/automation status in Port.  

By default, this is set to `true`. To disable this option, set the `reportWorkflowStatus` field to `true` in the `invocationMethod` object, or set the `Report workflow status` option to `No` if using the UI.

## Limitations

### Input limit

A GitHub workflow can have **up to 10** input parameters. Note this when defining your payloads.  
If you need more than 10 inputs, you can use a JSON object as a single parameter.

### Workflow chains

A workflow triggered using the `workflow_dispatch` trigger is self-contained. This means its actions and effects over the repository cannot trigger other automatic workflows.  

For example, take the following scenario:

1. A developer executes a "Create a new microservice in a monorepo" workflow.
2. The workflow opens a new pull request in the target repository based on a pre-defined template.
3. The repository also has a workflow which is automatically triggered using the `on: pull_request: types: "opened"` trigger.
4. In this instance, the automatic PR workflow **will not** be triggered.
