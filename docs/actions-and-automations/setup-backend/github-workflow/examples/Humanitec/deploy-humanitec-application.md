# Deploy Application In Humanitec

## Overview
This self service guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough on how to deploy an application in Humanitec from Port using Port's self service actions.

:::tip Prerequisites

1. [Port's GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/getport-io) needs to be installed.
2. In your GitHub repository, [go to **Settings > Secrets**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) and add the following secrets:
   - `HUMANITEC_API_KEY` - [Humanitec API Key](https://developer.humanitec.com/platform-orchestrator/reference/api-references/#authentication)
   - `HUMANITEC_ORG_ID` - [Humanitec Organization ID](https://developer.humanitec.com/concepts/organizations/)
   - `PORT_CLIENT_ID` - Your port `client id` [How to get the credentials](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/api/#find-your-port-credentials).
   - `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your port `client secret` [How to get the credentials](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/api/#find-your-port-credentials).
3. Optional - Install Port's Humanitec integration [learn more](/docs/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/api/ci-cd/github-workflow/guides/humanitec/humanitec.md)

:::tip Humanitec Integration
This step is not required for this example, but it will create all the blueprint boilerplate for you, and also ingest and update the catalog in real time with your Humanitec Application.

## GitHub Workflow

Create the file `.github/workflows/deploy-humanitec-application.yaml` in the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository.

<GithubDedicatedRepoHint/>

<details>
<summary>GitHub Workflow</summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers title="deploy-humanitec-application.yaml"

## Port Configuration

Create a new self service action using the following JSON configuration.

<details>
<summary><b> Deploy application In Humanitec (click to expand) </b></summary>

<GithubActionModificationHint/>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "deploy_application",
  "title": "Deploy Application",
  "icon": "Microservice",
  "description": "Deploy humanitec Application",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "self-service",
    "operation": "DAY-2",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "delta_id": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Delta ID",
          "description": "Delta ID",
          "icon": "Deployment"
        },
        "comment": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Comment on the deployment",
          "title": "Comment"
        },
        "environment": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Environment",
          "description": "Deployment environment ID",
          "blueprint": "humanitecEnvironment",
          "format": "entity"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "delta_id"
      ],
      "order": [
        "delta_id",
        "comment"
      ]
    },
    "blueprintIdentifier": "humanitecApplication"
  },
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "GITHUB",
    "org": "<GITHUB_ORG>",
    "repo": "<GITHUB_REPO>",
    "workflow": "deploy-humanitec-application.yaml",
    "workflowInputs": {
      "delta_id": "{{ .inputs.\"delta_id\" }}",
      "comment": "{{ .inputs.\"comment\" }}",
      "port_context": {
        "blueprint": "{{.action.blueprint}}",
        "entity": "{{.entity.identifier}}",
        "run_id": "{{.run.id}}"
      }
    },
    "reportWorkflowStatus": true
  },
  "requiredApproval": false
}
```
</details>

Now you should see the `Deploy Application` action in the self-service page. ðŸŽ‰

## Let's test it!

1. Go to the [Self Service page](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) of your portal.
2. Click on the `Deploy Application` action
3. Choose the humanitec application you want to deploy (In case you didn't install the [Humanitec integration](/docs/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/api/ci-cd/github-workflow/guides/humanitec/humanitec.md), it means you don't have any Humanitec applications in Port yet, so you will need to create one manually in Port to test this action)
4. Select the new application
5. Enter the `Delta ID` of the deployment, select an `Environment` you want to deploy to and brief `Comment` about the deployment.
6. Click on `Execute`
7. Done! wait for the application to be deployed in Humanitec

Congrats ðŸŽ‰ You've deployed a Humanitec application in Port ðŸ”¥
