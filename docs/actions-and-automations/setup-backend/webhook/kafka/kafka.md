# Kafka Self-Service Actions

Port manages a Kafka Topic per customer that publishes the execution run requests.

You can listen to a Kafka Topic with any code platform you wish to use, and also use it as a trigger for a serverless function. For example, AWS Lambda.

![Port Kafka Architecture](/img/self-service-actions/portKafkaArchitecture.jpg)

The steps shown in the image above are as follows:

1. Port publishes an invoked `Action` or `Change` message to Kafka;
2. A secure Kafka topic holds all of the action invocations and changes;

:::note about topics
The actions and changes topics are separated, their formats are:

- Action Topic - `ORG_ID.runs`
- Changes Topic - `ORG_ID.change.log`

:::

:::note about consumer groups
As part of the setup, you will need to create a consumer group that listens to the topics. The consumer group id can be one of:

- Any group name with a prefix of your org id, for example `ORG_ID.my-group-name`
- A group name that matches your username provided by Port

:::

3. A listener implemented on the Client side receives the new topic message and runs code defined by the DevOps team.

:::info
The listener can be anything that can read from a Kafka topic and run code based on the received message, for example:

- AWS Lambda;
- Python code that reads from the topic;
- Docker container running code.

You control how you interact with these topics, in the way that best suits your organization and infrastructure.
:::

An example flow would be:

1. A developer asks to deploy a new version of an existing `Microservice`;
2. The `create` action is sent to the `runs` Kafka topic;
3. An AWS Lambda function is triggered by this new action message;
4. The Lambda function deploys a new version of the service;
5. When the Lambda is done, it reports back to Port about the new Microservice `Deployment`.
