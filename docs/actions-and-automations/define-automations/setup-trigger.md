# Setup trigger

Automation triggers events in your software catalog that you want to act upon.  
Port supports two types of triggers:
- **Entity**: Triggered when an an entity of a specified blueprint is modified.
- **Action run**: Triggered when an [action run](/actions-and-automations/reflect-action-progress/) of a specified action is modified.

## Available triggers

The following trigger events are available for each type:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="entity" label="Entity">

| Trigger | Description | JSON event type identifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Entity creation | Triggered when any entity based on the selected blueprint is **created**. | `ENTITY_CREATED` |
| Entity update | Triggered when any entity based on the selected blueprint is **updated**. | `ENTITY_UPDATED` |
| Entity deletion | Triggered when any entity based on the selected blueprint is **deleted**. | `ENTITY_DELETED` |
| Any entity change | Triggered when any entity based on the selected blueprint is **created**, **updated**, or **deleted**. | `ANY_ENTITY_CHANGE` |
| Timer expiration | Triggered when the selected timer property set on an entity based on the selected blueprint **expires**. | `TIMER_PROPERTY_EXPIRED` |

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="action" label="Action run">

| Trigger | Description | JSON event type identifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Action run creation | Triggered when an action run is **created**. In other words, whenever the specified action is executed. | `RUN_CREATED` |
| Action run update | Triggered when an action run is [patched](https://docs.getport.io/api-reference/patch-an-action-run/) or [approved](https://docs.getport.io/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/#configure-manual-approval-for-actions).<br/>**Note** that sending logs to the action run will **not** count as a trigger. | `RUN_UPDATED` |
| Any action run change | Triggered when an action run is **created**, **patched**, or **approved**. | `ANY_RUN_CHANGE` |

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Trigger JSON structure

An automation's trigger is defined under the `trigger` key:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "unique_id",
  "title": "Title",
  "icon": "icon_identifier",
  "description": "automation description",
  # highlight-start
  "trigger": {
    "type": "automation",
    "event": {
      "type": "event_type",
      // Only one of "blueprintIdentifier" or "actionIdentifier" should be present depending on the trigger type
      "blueprintIdentifier": "blueprint_id",
      // OR
      "actionIdentifier": "action_id"
    },
    "condition": {
      "type": "JQ",
      "expressions": ["expression1", "expression2"],
      "combinator": "and"
    }
  },
  # highlight-end
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "WEBHOOK",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "publish": false
}
```
<br/>

The table below describes the fields in the JSON structure under the `trigger` key (fields in **bold** are required):

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`type`** | The automation's trigger type. Should be set to `automation`. |
| **`event`** | An object containing data about the event that triggers the automation. |
| **`event.type`** | The [trigger event type](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-trigger#available-triggers). |
| **`event.blueprintIdentifier`**<br/>or<br/>**`event.actionIdentifier`** | If using an *entity trigger* - the identifier of the blueprint whose entities will trigger the automation.<br/>If using an *action run trigger* - the identifier of the action whose runs will trigger the automation. |
| `condition` | An optional object containing `jq` expressions used to determine which entities the automation will be triggered for. |
| `condition.type` | The type of condition. Should be set to `JQ`. |
| `condition.expressions` | An array of expressions used to filter the entities for which the automation will be triggered. |
| `condition.combinator` | The combinator used to combine the expressions. Should be set to `and` or `or`. |

## Conditions

You can use the `condition` key to filter the entities for which the automation will be triggered.  

The following condition example contains a single expression that will cause the automation to trigger only for entities with a `status` property set to `Active`:

```json showLineNumbers
"condition": {
  "type": "JQ",
  "expressions": [
    ".diff.after.properties.status == \"Active\""
  ],
  "combinator": "and"
}
```

The data that is available to you when writing expressions contains useful information about the entity and the event that triggered the automation. 

Here is an example of what this object could look like for an automation that triggers whenever a `service` entity is **updated**:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "action": "UPDATE",
  "resourceType": "entity",
  "trigger": {
    "by": {
      "orgId": "org_BneDtWovPqXaA2VZ",
      "userId": "auth0|62ceaea697ca00f09d7c4f45"
    },
    "origin": "UI",
    "at": "2024-06-09T12:28:18.477Z"
  },
  "context": {
    "blueprintIdentifier": "service",
    "entityIdentifier": "example-service-identifier",
    "propertyIdentifier": null
  },
  "diff": {
    "before": {
      "identifier": "example-service-identifier",
      "title": "Example service",
      "icon": null,
      "blueprint": "service",
      "team": [
        "Rocket"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "latestVersion": "12.8.2",
        "language": "TypeScript",
        "one_hop_service_language": "Ruby",
        "two_hops_service_language": "Ruby",
        "repo": "https://github.com/some-org/example-service"
      },
      "relations": {
        "using": "rogue-service"
      },
      "createdAt": "2024-06-09T09:57:52.931Z",
      "createdBy": "60EsooJtOqimlekxrNh7nfr2iOgTcyLZ",
      "updatedAt": "2024-06-09T09:57:52.931Z",
      "updatedBy": "60EsooJtOqimlekxrNh7nfr2iOgTcyLZ"
    },
    "after": {
      "identifier": "example-service-identifier",
      "title": "Example service renamed",
      "icon": "Microservice",
      "blueprint": "service",
      "team": [
        "Rocket"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "latestVersion": "12.8.22",
        "language": "Python",
        "one_hop_service_language": "Ruby",
        "two_hops_service_language": "Ruby",
        "repo": "https://github.com/some-org/example-service"
      },
      "relations": {
        "using": "rogue-service"
      },
      "createdAt": "2024-06-09T09:57:52.931Z",
      "createdBy": "60EsooJtOqimlekxrNh7nfr2iOgTcyLZ",
      "updatedAt": "2024-06-09T12:28:18.628Z",
      "updatedBy": "auth0|62ceaea697ca00f09d7c4f45"
    }
  }
}
```

The example above is for an automation that uses the `ENTITY_UPDATED` trigger event. The `diff` object contains data from `before` and `after` the update.  

The other trigger events have the same structure, with the following differences:

- `ENTITY_CREATED` - In the `diff` object, `before` will be `null`, and `after` will contain the new entity data.

- `ENTITY_DELETED` - In the `diff` object, `before` will contain the entity data before deletion, and `after` will be `null`.

- `ANY_ENTITY_CHANGE` - The `diff` object will contain `before` and `after` data according to the entity change.

- `TIMER_PROPERTY_EXPIRED` - In the `diff` object, there will be an `after` object containing the entity data.
