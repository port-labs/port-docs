# Define automations

Naturally, your developer portal holds valuable information about your organizationâ€™s techstack, environments and dependencies. Port enables you to use this data to automate workflows and business logic, simplifying routine processes and making your organization more efficient and secure.

Automations in Port are triggered by events in your infrastructure, such as a new service being created, a cloud account being provisioned, or a new package being added to your software catalog. These events can be used to trigger pre-defined workflows running any logic, such as updating your software catalog, sending notifications, or provisioning new resources.

Port uses the same actions for automations and for [self-service actions](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/), so any backend option available for self-service actions can be used in automations as well.

## Common automations

- Create a new incident in PagerDuty when CPU usage is greater than X%.
- Destroy an ephemeral environment when its TTL expires.
- Send a Slack message for each new alert.

## How does it work?

Automations are comprised of two parts:

1. **Trigger** - An event in your software catalog that you want to act upon. This can be any one of the events defined [here](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-trigger).
2. **Action** - The logic that you want to execute when the trigger event occurs. This can be any one of the actions defined [here](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-action). 

When an event occurs in your software catalog, Port will automatically trigger the associated action, given that the automation is enabled.  

By default, automations are disabled and can be used as drafts until ready to be activated. You can enable them by setting the `publish` field to `true` in their JSON definition.

## JSON structure

Automations are defined in JSON format. The JSON structure looks like this:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "unique_id",
  "title": "Title",
  "icon": "icon_identifier",
  "description": "automation description",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "automation",
    "event": {
      "type": "event_type",
      "blueprintIdentifier": "blueprint_id"
    },
    "condition": {
      "type": "JQ",
      "expressions": ["expression1", "expression2"],
      "combinator": "and"
    }
  },
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "WEBHOOK",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  },
  "publish": false
}
```
<br/>
The table below describes the fields in the JSON structure (fields in **bold** are required):
| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`identifier`** | The automation's unique identifier. |
| `title` | The automation's title. |
| `icon` | The automation's icon. |
| `description` | A description that can be used to explain the automation. |
| **`trigger`** | An object containing data about the automation's trigger. See [Setup trigger](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-trigger) for more information. |
| **`invocationMethod`** | An object containing data about the automation's invocation method. See [Setup action](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-action) for more information. |
| `publish` | A boolean value indicating whether the automation is enabled or disabled (`false` by default). |

## Define an automation

Automations are defined in the [Automations page](https://app.getport.io/settings/automations) of your portal. Here you can create, edit, and delete automations, as well as enable or disable them.

1. Click on the `+ New automation` button in the top-right corner. This will open a JSON form where you can define the automation's configuration.

2. Change the JSON configuration to match your desired automation:
   * Setup the [trigger](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-trigger).
   * Define the [action](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-action) that will be executed when the trigger event occurs.

3. Make sure to set the `publish` field to `true` if you want to enable the automation. When finished, click `Save`.
