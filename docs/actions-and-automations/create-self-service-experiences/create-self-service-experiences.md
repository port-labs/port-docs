Drive developer productivity by allowing developers to use self-service actions like scaffolding a service or provisioning a cloud resource. Developer self-service drives consistency and repeatability and ensures that their routines are intuitive and clear, all with guardrails like manual approvals or consumption policies to comply with organizational standards.

Port's action model is designed to be flexible and can be used to cover a wide range of use-cases:

1. **Unopinionated** - flexible UI to create a wide range of self-service actions.
2. **Leverages existing infrastructure** and automations as the backend of your actions.
3. **Loosely coupled** to your infrastructure and architecture.
4. **Stateful** - every invoked action affects the software catalog by adding/modifying/deleting one or more entities.
5. **Secure by design** - does not require keys to sensitive infrastructure by using an event-based model. All actions are audited and can include guardrails like manual approval and TTL.

## üí° Common self-service actions

- [**Scaffold** a new service](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/scaffold-a-new-service/).
- [**Create** a cloud resource](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/create-cloud-resource-using-iac).
- **Provision** a temporary developer environment.
- **Redeploy** an image tag.
- **Rollback** a running service.
- **Change** a deployment's replica count.

In our [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/self-serve), you can see examples for self-service experiences. üé¨

## How does it work?

1. A user **executes an action** from Port's UI interface.
2. A pre-defined **payload** containing any desired metadata about the action and its inputs is **sent** to your infrastructure.
3. A **job is triggered** and the user gets a **continuous indication** about its progress.
4. Once the action is running, you can use Port's API to **update Port on its status** and provide information such as **logs and links to the resulting handlers**.

## Create a self-service action

Creating a self-service experience in port is very similar to a traditional frontend-backend model.
Port gives you no-code components to create the experience you want for your users and integrates with existing workflows and automations provided by you.

Self-service actions are created and managed in the [Self-service](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) page of your portal.  

To begin, click on the `+ Action` button in the top right corner, then follow the steps below.

:::tip Other supported methods
Besides Port's UI, you can also create and manage self-service actions using [Port's API](/api-reference/create-an-action-automation), or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/port-labs/port-labs/latest/docs/resources/port_action).
:::

### Set up the action's frontend

Choose the name of the action, its icon, and the inputs you would like the user to fill out when executing it.
Port supports a wide variety of input types, including more advanced conditions to best fit the experience you want for your users.

See [Set up frontend](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/setup-ui-for-action/) for instructions and examples.

### Set up backend

Set up the logic responsible to handle the action after it is executed.  
In this step you can also define the payload that will be sent to your handler upon execution.

The backend logic is yours, so it can do whatever you need it to do. Port supports many different backends for actions, offering a secure and compliant architecture.

As part of your backend and its logic implementation, you can keep your software catalog up to date by sending API requests or ingesting new data that is tied to the performed action (for example, adding a new service entity in Port once the scaffold process has finished).

See [Set up backend](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/setup-the-backend/) for instructions and examples.

### Optional Step - ‚úãüèº set guardrails

Port supports a variety of ways to add manual approvals, policies, and TTL to actions, to ensure that organizational standards are met.

See [Set actions RBAC](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/) for instructions and examples.

### Execute the action

<ExecuteActionLocations />

:::tip Execute in JSON format
When executing an action from the UI, a `JSON mode` toggle is available, allowing you to view and edit the action's inputs in JSON format.  
Note that this toggle will not be available when executing an action that has multiple [steps](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/setup-ui-for-action/#steps).
:::

### Reflect action progress

After executing an action, Port allows you update its state and progress, using a `success/in-progress/failure` status, live logs, ChatOps notifications, friendly and indicative error messages, and more.

See [Reflect action progress](/actions-and-automations/reflect-action-progress/) for instructions and examples.

## Action JSON structure

The basic structure of a self-service action looks like this (see key descriptions below):

## Examples

For complete examples of self-service actions using GitHub as the backend, check out the [guides section](/guides?tags=GitHub&tags=Actions).

## Track self-service actions

To gain visibility into how your self-service actions are being used and their performance, you can set up tracking for action runs. This allows you to monitor execution patterns, track success rates, and maintain audit trails to follow what actions were executed and when. 

The following tracking system works by creating a dedicated blueprint for action runs and setting up an automation that captures execution details whenever a specific self-service action is triggered as well as an automation that updates the action run's status.

<h3>Set up data model</h3>

Create a blueprint for `Action run`:

1. Go to the [Data model](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.

2. Click on `+ Blueprint`.

3. Click on the `{...} Edit JSON` button in the top right corner.

4. Copy and paste the following JSON schema, then click `Save`.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Action run blueprint (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ``` json
    {
      "identifier": "action_run",
      "title": "Action run",
      "icon": "Microservice",
      "schema": {
        "properties": {
          "status": {
            "icon": "DefaultProperty",
            "title": "Status",
            "type": "string",
            "enum": [
              "SUCCESS",
              "FAILURE",
              "IN_PROGRESS",
              "WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL",
              "DECLINED"
            ],
            "enumColors": {
              "SUCCESS": "green",
              "FAILURE": "red",
              "IN_PROGRESS": "lightGray",
              "WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL": "yellow",
              "DECLINED": "red"
            }
          },
          "created_at": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Created At",
            "format": "date-time"
          },
          "run_id": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Run ID"
          },
          "run_url": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Run URL",
            "format": "url"
          },
          "updated_at": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Updated At",
            "format": "date-time"
          },
          "action": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Action"
          }
        },
        "required": []
      },
      "mirrorProperties": {},
      "calculationProperties": {},
      "aggregationProperties": {},
      "relations": {}
    }
    ```
    </details>


<h3>Define the automation</h3>

The following automation updates the `Action run` entity with information regarding this run.  
To add it, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Automations](https://app.getport.io/settings/automations) page of your portal.

2. Click on the `+ Automation` button.

3. Click on the `{...} Edit JSON` button in the top right corner.

4. Copy and paste the following JSON configuration into the editor, then click `Save`.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Update `Action run` automation definition (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ``` json 
    {
      "identifier": "update_action_run",
      "title": "Update Action Run",
      "description": "",
      "trigger": {
        "type": "automation",
        "event": {
          "type": "ANY_RUN_CHANGE",
          "actionIdentifier": "<THE_ACTION_IDENTIFIER>"
        },
        "condition": {
          "type": "JQ",
          "expressions": [],
          "combinator": "and"
        }
      },
      "invocationMethod": {
        "type": "UPSERT_ENTITY",
        "blueprintIdentifier": "action_run",
        "mapping": {
          "identifier": "{{.event.diff.after.id}}",
          "title": "{{.event.diff.after.id}}",
          "properties": {
            "run_id": "{{.event.diff.after.id}}",
            "run_url": "https://app.port.io/organization/run?runId={{.event.diff.after.id}}",
            "status": "{{.event.diff.after.status}}",
            "created_at": "{{.event.diff.after.createdAt}}",
            "updated_at": "{{.event.diff.after.updatedAt}}",
            "action": "{{.event.diff.after.action.title}}"
          },
          "relations": {}
        }
      },
      "publish": true
    }
    ```
    </details>

Once implemented, you can track your self-service action runs and see how they are progressing.  

For example, you can create the following widget to vizualize how `Action runs` are distributed by status for a specific `Action` over the past month:

1. Click **`+ Widget`** and select **Pie chart**.

2. Give the widget a `title` and a `description`.

3. Choose the `Action run` blueprint.

4. Under `Breakdown by property`, select the **status** property.

5. Under `Additional filters` you can choose to filter by:
   - `Action runs` that were created in the past month.
   - `Action runs` of a specific self-service action.  

    Click on `filters`, then on `{...} Edit JSON`, and add the following snippet with your action title and relevant time frame.  
    Below is a JSON example for `Create s3 bucket` self-service action in the past month:

    <details>
    <summary><b>filters JSON example (click to expand)</b></summary>
      ``` json showLineNumbers
      {
        "combinator": "and",
        "rules": [
          {
            "property": "created_at",
            "operator": "between",
            "value": {
              "preset": "lastMonth"
            }
          },
          {
            "property": "action",
            "operator": "=",
            "value": "Create s3 bucket" // Change the value to your action name
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
    </details>

6. Click `Save`.

This will result in a widget similar to the following:  

<img src='/img/self-service-actions/actionRunsPieChartExample.png' width='70%' border='1px' />
