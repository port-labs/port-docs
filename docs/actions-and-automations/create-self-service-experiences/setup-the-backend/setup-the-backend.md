Port's self-service actions support a variety of backends that can be used when triggered.

Here is the basic backend model:

<br/><br/>

## Define the backend

Port uses the same backend types and configurations for both self-service actions and [automations](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/).

All available backends and their configurations can be found [here](/actions-and-automations/setup-backend/).

## Next step

Once the backend is set up, the action is ready to be used.  
Optionally, you can [configure permissions and/or manual approval](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/) for your actions to control who is allowed to execute them.
