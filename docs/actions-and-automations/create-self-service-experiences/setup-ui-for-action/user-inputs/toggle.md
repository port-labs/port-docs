# Toggle (Boolean)

Toggle is a basic boolean input that has one of two possible values - `true` and `false`.  
In Port, this input type is represented by a switch that can be toggled on or off.

:::warning Required field behavior
The "required" property has no effect on toggle inputs since they always have a value (either `true` or `false` based on the default). Unlike other input types, users cannot leave a toggle in an empty state, so the required validation doesn't apply.

If you need a boolean input that can be left unset (null), consider using a [select input](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/setup-ui-for-action/user-inputs/select) with options for `true`, `false`, and `null`.
:::

:::info Toggle vs Boolean properties
Toggle inputs in actions differ from Boolean properties in blueprints:
- **Toggle inputs** (actions): Always have a value (`true` or `false`) and appear as a switch
- **Boolean properties** (blueprints): Can be `null`, `true`, or `false` and support optional/unset states
:::

## ðŸ’¡ Common toggle usage

This input type can be used to store any true/false gate, for example:

- Is environment locked for deployments
- Should environment perform nightly shutdown
- Does service handle PII
- Is environment public

In the [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/self-serve) self-service hub page, we can see the **Delete Repo** action whose `Confirm` input is a toggle input. ðŸŽ¬
