#### Using secrets in the payload

Sensitive data such as tokens and passwords can be stored using [Port secrets](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/).

To use a secret in the payload, you can reference it using `{{ .secrets.<secret_name> }}`.

For example:

```json
"token": "{{ .secrets.token_name }}"
```

#### spreadValue() function

You can use the `spreadValue()` function to add multiple keys to the root of the payload at once. This function will spread all of the keys under a given object.  
A common use case for this function is to add all of the user inputs to the payload:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "{{ spreadValue() }}": "{{ .inputs }}"
}
```

This will add all of the action's user inputs to the root of the payload, so that they can be accessed directly by your backend.

#### Using `jq` expressions in keys

The keys in the payload can also be `jq` expressions.  
For example, the following expression will add the `ref` key to the payload only if a `ref` input was provided when executing the action:

```json
{
  "{{if (.inputs | has(\"ref\")) then \"ref\" else null end}}": "{{.inputs.ref}}"
}
```

:::warning Using jq in keys
Note that if a **key** in the payload evaluates to `null` for any reason, the entire expression (key + value) will be omitted from the payload.
