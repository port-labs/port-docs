# Getting started

After [signing up](https://app.getport.io) to Port, you will be prompted to follow an onboarding process that aims to help you start building your developer portal, using real data from tools in your tech stack.

This section will walk you through the phases of the onboarding process, and describe the components that Port will create for you. 

## Onboarding steps

1. [Connect your tools](./connect-tools.md) - Select the tools and platforms used in your organization, and connect them to to your portal.

2. [Set up your service catalog](./set-up-service-catalog.md) - Create some core components to start populating your software catalog with data from your tools.

3. [Set up automatic discovery](./set-up-automatic-discovery.md) - Learn how to manage your catalog automatically, creating and updating components based on changes in data from your tools.

Upon creating your portal, Port will create several [default components](./default-components.md) to help you build and organize your software catalog.
