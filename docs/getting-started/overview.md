# Getting Started

After [signing up](https://app.getport.io) to Port, you will be prompted to follow an onboarding process that aims to help you get started with Port quickly, using real data from tools in your tech stack.

This section will walk you through the phases of the onboarding process, and describe the components that Port will create for you. 

## Onboarding Steps

1. [Connect Your Git Provider](./connect-git-provider.md) - Connect your Git provider to Port to start populating your software catalog with repositories and pull requests.

2. [Choose Your Tools](./choose-tools.md) - Select the tools and platforms used in your organization to prepare for integration with Port.

3. [Install Integrations](./install-integrations.md) - Install the integrations for your selected tools to start ingesting data into your software catalog.

After completing these steps, Port will create several [default components](./default-components.md) in your portal to help you get started with organizing your software catalog.
