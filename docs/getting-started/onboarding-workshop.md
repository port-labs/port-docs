# Onboarding workshop

Following the in-app onboarding process, Port offers a [**modular, self-paced workshop**](https://github.com/port-experimental/onboarding-workshop) hosted on GitHub to help you and others in your organization proceed and get the most value from Port.

The workshop teaches how to build and configure an internal developer portal, covering everything from basic navigation to advanced infrastructure-as-code management, including exercises, assessments, and real-world examples.

The workshop accommodates multiple personas and introduces four different learning paths:
- [Quick-start path](https://github.com/port-experimental/onboarding-workshop/blob/main/learning-paths/quick-start.md)  
  Perfect for experienced developers who want to get up and running quickly.
- [Developer path](https://github.com/port-experimental/onboarding-workshop/blob/main/learning-paths/developer.md)  
  Ideal for developers who will use Port for day-to-day development tasks.
- [Platform engineer path](https://github.com/port-experimental/onboarding-workshop/blob/main/learning-paths/platform-engineer.md)  
  Designed for platform engineers who will configure and manage Port.
- [Manager path](https://github.com/port-experimental/onboarding-workshop/blob/main/learning-paths/manager.md)  
  High-level overview for managers and decision makers.
