# Set up your service catalog

### Default blueprints


Every Port account comes with a set of default blueprints.  
Three of these blueprints are designed to help you create a rich and dynamic service catalog:

1. [`_service`](/) *(these will link to the docs page that explains the meaning of these default blueprints)*
2. [`_workload`](/)
3. [`_environment`](/)

Read on to learn how to use these blueprints in a way that best suits your organization.

### Create entities


To help you onboard services, workloads and environments, this page contains several actions for you to execute.  
These actions will create entities, with rich context from the tools you've integrated.  

For example:  
Say you've integrated `GitHub`, `Jira`, and `Pagerduty`.  
When onboarding a service via the action, you will be able to select the relevant `GitHub repository`, `Jira project`, and `Pagerduty service` related to that service.  
This will create a single `service` entity, with relations to the relevant entities you selected, serving as a single component to track & manage the service.

The relevant onboarding actions can be found below, along with tables that display the created entities.

### Automatic discovery 

The onboarding actions are a great way to get started, but eventually you may want to automate this process.
