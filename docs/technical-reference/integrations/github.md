# GitHub App

Our Github app allows you to quickly and easily map out your Software Catalog according to your existing code repositories and projects

You can visit [our GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/getport-io) page to get started.

Here you'll find a step-by-step guide to installing the GitHub App of Port.

## What does our GitHub application give you?

- Automatic mapping of your and creation of your Microservices in Port, based on your existing code repositories
- Automatic updates to the entities mapped from Github based on updates to the `port.yml` file
- Additional metadata provided by Github, available directly from Port

## How does our GitHub App Work?

In order to use the Github App all you need to do is include a `port.yml` file in your code repositories, or multiple `port.yml` files in your Monorepo.

The `port.yml` file format is very similar to a standard Port Entity, here is an example:

```yaml showLineNumbers
apiVersion: v0.1
identifier: example
title: Example
blueprint: Microservice
properties: 
  repository: https://github.com/port-labs/github-app-setup-example
  owner: port-labs
  runtime: NodeJs
  slack-channel: prod-alerts
  grafana: https://play.grafana.org/d/000000012/grafana-play-home
```

### Triggers

Merging a branch to the `main` (default) branch will trigger the app look for the input type.

### Permissions



## What our GitHub app provides out of the box?

### GitHub environment variables

| variable name | Type | Description | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| `identifier` | `String` | A unique identifier. <br /> **Note that** while the identifier is unique, it can be changed after creation. |
