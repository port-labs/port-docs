# Scaffold a new service

This guide takes 7 minutes to complete, and aims to demonstrate the power of self-service actions in Port.

:::tip Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a Port account and a basic knowledge of working with Port. If you haven't done so, go ahead and complete the [quickstart](/quickstart).

- You will need a Github repository in which you can place a workflow that we will use in this guide. If you don't have one, we recommend [creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) named `Port-actions`.

:::

### The goal of this guide

In this guide we will create an action that initializes a new Github repository. In reality, such an action can be used by developers to scaffold new services.

After completing it, you will get a sense of how your organization's daily routine could look like:

- Developers will be able to scaffold new services easily.
- R&D managers will be able to get an overview of new services - how many were created and by who.
- Platform engineers will be able to control permissions to ensure only the relevant people can create new services.

### Create the action's frontend

1. To get started, head to the [Self-service tab](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) in your Port application, and click on `New action`:

<img src='/img/guides/actionsCreateNew.png' width='50%' />

2. Each action in Port is directly tied to a blueprint. Since we are creating a repository, the `Service` blueprint we created in the [quickstart guide](/quickstart) is an obvious candidate. Choose it from the dropdown.

3. Fill in the basic details of the action like this, then click `Next`:

<img src='/img/guides/actionBasicDetails.png' width='60%' />

4. The next step is to define the action's inputs. When someone uses this action, all we want them to enter is the new repository's name. Click on `New input`, fill in the form like this, then click on `Create`:

<img src='/img/guides/actionInputName.png' width='50%' />

:::info notes

- We set the `Required` field to `true` to ensure that a name is always provided when using this action.
- We set the type to `Text` since this is a name, but note all of the different types of input that Port allows.
- When using `Text` inputs, you can set constraints and limitations to enforce certain patterns.

:::

5. Now we'll define the backend of the action. Port supports multiple invocation types, for this tutorial we will use a `Github workflow`.
   - Replace the `Organization` and `Repository` values with your values (this is where the workflow will reside and run).
   - Name the workflow `portCreateRepo.yaml`.
   - Fill out the rest of the form like this, then click `Next`:

<img src='/img/guides/backendGithub.png' width='75%' />

6. The last step is customizing the action's permissions. For simplicity's sake, we will use the default settings. For more information, see the [permissions](/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/) page. Click `Create`.

The action's frontend is now ready ü•≥

### Create the action's backend

Now we want to write the logic that our action will trigger.

:::info Important
If the Github organization which will house your workflow is not the same as the one you'll create the new repository in, install Port's [Github app](https://github.com/apps/getport-io) in the other organization as well.
:::

1. First, let's create the necessary token and secrets:

- Go to your [Github tokens page](https://github.com/settings/tokens), create a personal access token with `repo` and `admin:org` scope, and copy it (this token is needed to create a repo from our workflow).

  <img src='/img/guides/personalAccessToken.png' width='80%' />

  - Go to your [Port application](https://app.getport.io/), hover over the `...` in the top right corner, then click `Credentials`. Copy your `Client ID` and `Client secret`.

2. In the repository where your workflow will reside, create 3 new secrets under `Settings->Secrets and variables->Actions`:

- `ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN` - the personal access token you created in the previous step.
- `PORT_CLIENT_ID` - the client ID you copied from your Port app.
- `PORT_CLIENT_SECRET` - the client secret you copied from your Port app.

<img src='/img/guides/repositorySecret.png' width='80%' />

3. Now let's create the workflow file that contains our logic. Under ".github/workflows", create a new file named `portCreateRepo.yaml` and use the following snippet as its content:

Change `<YOUR-ORG-NAME>` to the name of the organization in which you want to create the new repository.

<details>
<summary><b>Github workflow (click to expand)</b></summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
# portCreateRepo.yaml

name: Port action - create repository
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      service_name:
        type: string
      port_payload:
        required: true
        description: Port's payload, including details for who triggered the action and general context
        type: string
jobs:
  create-repository:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Create repository
    steps:
      - name: Create service
        uses: octobay/create-repository-action@v1
        with:
          name: ${{ inputs.service_name }}
          org: "<YOUR-ORG-NAME>" # change this to the org name in which you want to create the new repo
          access-token: ${{ secrets.ORG_ADMIN_TOKEN }}
          private-repo: true
          initialize-repo: true
  reflect-action-result: # Send action progress/result back to Port
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create a log message
        uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
        with:
          clientId: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_ID }}
          clientSecret: ${{ secrets.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          operation: PATCH_RUN
          runId: ${{fromJson(inputs.port_payload).context.runId}}
          logMessage: New service "${{ inputs.service_name }}" created successfully üöÄ
```

</details>

All done! The action is ready to be used üöÄ

### Execute the action

After creating an action, it will appear under the `Self-service` tab of your Port application:

<img src='/img/guides/selfServiceAfterCreation.png' width='75%' />

1. Click on `Create` to begin executing the action.

2. Enter a name for your new repository, then click `Execute`. A small popup will appear, click on `View details`:

<img src='/img/guides/executionDetails.png' width='45%' />

3. This page provides details about the action run. As you can see, the backend returned `Success` and the repo was successfully created:

<img src='/img/guides/runStatus.png' width='90%' />

üí° Note the `Log stream` at the bottom, this can be used to report progress, results and errors

Congrats! You can now create services easily from Port üí™üèΩ

### Possible daily routine integrations

- Send a slack message in the R&D channel to let everyone know that a new service was created.
- Send a weekly/monthly report for managers showing all the new services created in this timeframe and their owners.

### Conclusion

Creating a service is not just a periodic task developers undertake, but a vital step that can occur on a monthly basis. However, it's crucial to recognize that this is only a fragment of the broader experience that we're striving to create for developers.  
Our ultimate goal is to facilitate a seamless transition from ideation to production. In doing so, we aim to eliminate the need for developers to navigate through a plethora of tools, reducing friction and accelerating the time-to-production.  
In essence, we're not just building a tool, but sculpting an ecosystem that empowers developers to bring new features to life with utmost efficiency.

More guides & tutorials will be available soon, in the meantime feel free to reach out with any questions via our [community slack](https://www.getport.io/community) or [Github project](https://github.com/port-labs?view_as=public).
