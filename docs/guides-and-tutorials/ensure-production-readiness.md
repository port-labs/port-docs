# Ensure production readiness

This guide takes 10 minutes to complete, and aims to cover:

- Some advanced types of properties that can be added to blueprints, and what can be achieved by using them.
- The value and flexibility of scorecards in Port.

:::tip Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a Port account and a basic knowledge of working with Port. If you haven't done so, go ahead and complete the [quickstart](/quickstart).

- You will need an accessible k8s cluster. If you don't have one, here is how to quickly set-up a [minikube cluster](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - required to install a relevant integration.

:::

### The goal of this guide

In this guide we will set various standards for the production readiness of our services, and see how to use them as part of our CI.

After completing it, you will get a sense of how your organization's daily routine could look like:

- Platform engineers will be able to define policies for any service, and automatically pass/fail releases accordingly.
- Developers will be able to easily see which policies set by the platform engineer are not met, and what they need to fix.
- R&D managers will get a bird's-eye-view of the state of all services in the organization.

## Expand your service blueprint

In this guide we will add 3 new properties to our `service` blueprint, which we will then use to set production readiness standards:

1. The service's `on-call`, fetched from Pagerduty.
2. The service's `Code owners`, fetched from Github.
3. A url to the relevant `Slack channel`, calculated using the service's data.

### Add an on-call to your services

In this guide we will use Pagerduty to get our services' on-call. Note that Port also has integrations for other incident response platforms.

#### Create the necessary Pagerduty resources

If you already have a Pagerduty account that you can play around with, feel free to skip this step.

1. Create a [Pagerduty account](https://www.pagerduty.com/sign-up/)(free 14-day trial).

2. Create a new service:

![pagerdutyServiceCreation](/img/guides/pagerdutyServiceCreation.png)

- Name the service `DemoPdService`.
- Choose the existing `Default` escalation policy.
- Under `Reduce noise` use the recommended settings.
- Under `Integrations` scroll down and click on `Create service without an integration`.

#### Integrate Pagerduty into Port

Now let's bring our Pagerduty data into Port. Port's Pagerduty integration automatically fetches `Services` and `Incidents`, and creates blueprints and entities for them.

:::info Note
For this installation you will need Helm and a running K8s cluster (see [prerequisites](/guides-and-tutorials/ensure-production-readiness)).
:::

1. Install Port's Pagerduty integration using Helm, by running the command below in your terminal.

- Replace `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with your credentials (get them [here](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/api/#find-your-port-credentials)).

- Replace `token` with your Pagerduty token. To obtain it:
  - Hover over your avatar in the top right corner of your Pagerduty app, then click `My profile`.
  - Click the `User settings` tab and scroll to the bottom.
  - Click on `Create API User Token` and provide a name.
  - Copy the new token value.

<summary>Installation command (click to expand)</summary>

```bash showLineNumbers
helm repo add port-labs https://port-labs.github.io/helm-charts
helm upgrade --install my-pagerduty-integration port-labs/port-ocean \
    --set port.clientId="CLIENT_ID" \     # REPLACE VALUE
    --set port.clientSecret="CLIENT_SECRET"  \     # REPLACE VALUE
    --set initializePortResources=true  \
    --set integration.identifier="my-pagerduty-integration"  \
    --set integration.type="pagerduty"  \
    --set integration.eventListener.type="POLLING"  \
    --set integration.secrets.token="token"  \     # REPLACE VALUE
    --set integration.config.appHost="https://example.com"  \     # NO NEED TO REPLACE FOR THIS GUIDE
    --set integration.config.apiUrl="https://api.pagerduty.com"
```

</details>

Great! Now that the integration is installed, we should see some new components in Port:

- Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model), you should now see two new blueprints created by the integration - `PagerDuty Service` and `PagerDuty Incident`.
- Go to your [Software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services), click on `PagerDuty Services` in the sidebar, you should now see a new entity created for our `DemoPdService`, with a populated `On-call` property.

#### Add an on-call property to the service blueprint

Now that Port is synced with our Pagerduty resources, let's reflect the Pagerduty service's on-call in our services.  
First, we will need to create a [relation](/build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/relate-blueprints/#what-is-a-relation) between our services and the corresponding Pagerduty services.

1. Head back to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model), choose the `Service` blueprint, and click on `New relation`:

<img src='/img/guides/serviceCreateRelation.png' width='30%' />

2. Fill out the form like this, then click `Create`:

<img src='/img/guides/relationCreation.png' width='40%' />

Now that the blueprints are related, let's create a [mirror property](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/mirror-property/) in our service to display its on-call.

1. Choose the `Service` blueprint again, and under the `PagerDutyService` relation, click on `New mirror property`.  
   Fill the form out like this, then click `Create`:

<img src='/img/guides/mirrorPropertyCreation.png' width='40%' />

2. Now that our mirror property is set, we need to assign the relevant Pagerduty service to each of our services. Let's see an example - go to your [Software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services), choose any service in the table under `Services`, click on the `...`, and click `Edit`:

![editServiceEntity](/img/guides/editServiceEntity.png)

3. In the form you will now see a property named `PagerDutyService`, choose the `DemoPdService` we created from the dropdown, then click `Update`:

<img src='/img/guides/editServiceChoosePdService.png' width='40%' />

You can now see the on-call in the service: üéâ

![serviceAfterAssigningPdService](/img/guides/serviceAfterAssigningPdService.png)

### Display each service's code owners

Github allows adding a `CODEOWNERS` file to a repository. Let's see how we can easily ingest this into our existing services:

#### Add a codeowners property to the service blueprint

1. Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model) again, choose the `Service` blueprint, and click `New property`.

2. Fill in the form like this:  
   _Note the `identifier` field value, we will need it in the next step._

<img src='/img/guides/addCodeownersForm.png' width='40%' />

3. Next we will update the Github exporter mapping and add the new property. Go to your [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-sources).

4. Under `Exporters`, click on the Github exporter with your organization name.

5. In the mapping YAML, add the line `code_owners: file://CODEOWNERS` as shown here, then click `Resync`:

![mappingAddCodeOwners](/img/guides/mappingAddCodeOwners.png)

_Remember the `identifier` from step 2? This tells Port how to populate the new property_ üòé

Going back to our Catalog, we can now see that our entities have their code owners displayed:

![entityAfterCodeowners](/img/guides/entityAfterCodeowners.png)

### Display each service's relevant Slack channel

We will now use a [calculation property](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/calculation-property/) to build a URL to the relevant Slack channel.

1. Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model) yet again, choose the `Service` blueprint, and click `New property`.

2. Fill out the form like this, then click `Create`:  
   The `JQ calculation` field for copy-paste convenience: `"https://slack.com/" + .identifier`

<img src='/img/guides/createSlackClaculationProp.png' width='50%' />

Now each service has a Slack link that is composed of a base and the service's identifier:

![serviceAfterSlackProp](/img/guides/serviceAfterSlackProp.png)

This is an example of what can be achieved with calculation properties, you can use jq to craft and combine expressions/urls/numbers while also using the service's properties üõ†Ô∏è

### Update our service's scorecards

Now let's use the properties we created to set standards for our services.  
We already have a `bronze` level scorecard from the quickstart guide, so we'll add ones for other levels.

#### Add `silver` and `gold` metrics to your scorecard

Say we want to ensure each service meets several requirements, with different levels of importance.  
We can model it like this, for example:

- `Bronze` - each service must have a `Readme` (we have already defined this in the quickstart guide).
- `Silver`:
  - Each service must have a `CODEOWNERS` file.
  - Each service must have a link to a Slack channel.
- `Gold` - each service must have an on-call defined.

Now let's implement it:

1. Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model), choose the `Service` blueprint, click on `Scorecards`, then click our existing `Production readiness` scorecard:

<img src='/img/guides/editReadinessScorecard.png' width='30%' />

2. Replace the content with this, then click `Save`:

<details>
<summary>Scorecard schema (click to expand)</summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "ProductionReadiness",
  "title": "Production Readiness",
  "rules": [
    {
      "identifier": "hasReadme",
      "title": "Has readme",
      "level": "Bronze",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": "isNotEmpty",
            "property": "readme"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "identifier": "hasCodeowners",
      "title": "Has Codeowners",
      "level": "Silver",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": "isNotEmpty",
            "property": "code_owners"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "identifier": "hasSlackChannel",
      "title": "Has a Slack channel",
      "level": "Silver",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": "isNotEmpty",
            "property": "slack_channel"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "identifier": "hasOncall",
      "title": "Has On-call",
      "level": "Gold",
      "query": {
        "combinator": "and",
        "conditions": [
          {
            "operator": "isNotEmpty",
            "property": "on_call"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

Now go to your Catalog and click on any of your services. Click on the `Scorecards` tab and you will see the score of the service, with details of which checks passed/failed:

<img src='/img/guides/entityAfterReadinessScorecard.png' width='100%' />

### Possible daily routine integrations

- Use Port's API to check for scorecard compliance from your CI and pass/fail it accordingly.
- Notify periodically via Slack about services that fail gold/silver/bronze validations.
- Send a weekly/monthly report for managers showing the number of services that do not meet specific standards.

### Conclusion

Production readiness is something that needs to be monitored and handled constantly. In a microservice-heavy environment, things like codeowners and on-call management is critical.  
With Port, standards are easy to set-up, prioritize and track. Using Port's API, you can also create/get/modify your scorecards from anywhere, allowing seamless integration with other platforms and services in your environment.
