# ðŸ”’ SSO & RBAC

## Role-based access control

Port provides a high granularity RBAC mechanism, allowing you to fully control who sees, modifies, creates and deletes data and resources within the software catalog, and in actions that are exposed using the software catalog.

For more information on Port's RBAC capabilities check out the following resources:

- [Roles, teams & ownership in Port](rbac/rbac.md)
- [Software catalog RBAC](../build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/set-catalog-rbac.md)

## Single sign-on

Port integrates with all major SSO providers, allowing you to seamlessly import users, and teams, and also exposing Port to your organization in a managed manner.

By integrating an SSO with Port, you can utilize existing teams to assign permissions to users inside the software catalog.

To learn more about Port's SSO integrations and integrate the SSO provider you use with your Port, check out the [SSO](./sso-providers/sso-providers.md) page.
