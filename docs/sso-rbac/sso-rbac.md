# SSO & RBAC

This section discusses Port's RBAC capabilities, as well as guides to configure the integration between Port and your SSO.

## Role-based access control

Port offers extensive RBAC capabilities, allowing you to control the permissions of different components in Port, including the software catalog, dashboards, self-service actions, and much more.  

The [RBAC capabilities](/sso-rbac/rbac-overview/) page details all of the available configuration options.

## Single sign-on

Port integrates with all major SSO providers, allowing you to seamlessly import users, and teams, and also exposing Port to your organization in a managed manner.

By integrating an SSO with Port, you can utilize existing teams to assign permissions to users inside the software catalog.

To learn more about Port's SSO integrations and integrate the SSO provider you use with your Port, check out the [SSO](./sso-providers/sso-providers.md) page.
