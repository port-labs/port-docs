:::info multiple SSO applications for SCIM with OIDC
Due to technical limitations, OIDC integrations do not directly support SCIM. You will be required to set up another application, which will be handle provisioning based on the SCIM protocol.

With SCIM in place, in order to grant the user access to Port, you will need to assign the user both the primary SSO application and to the SCIM application.
