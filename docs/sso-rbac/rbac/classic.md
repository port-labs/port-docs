:::warning New default behavior
A new mechanism to manage users and teams has been released, using dedicated blueprints.  
Starting **January 6, 2025**, this will be the default behavior for all new Port accounts.

Accounts created before this date will continue to use the old behavior, with no changes to their current setup.

This page describes the **old behavior**.  
If you created your account **after** January 6, 2025, see the [**users & teams as blueprints**](/sso-rbac/rbac/classic) page.
