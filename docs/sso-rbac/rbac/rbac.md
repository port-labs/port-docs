# Port Roles & User management

Port's RBAC mechanism makes it possible to assign permissions to specific users and teams, as well as configure custom roles tailored to the needs of the different personas in Port.

## Assigning permissions

In Port, you can assign permissions by using [roles](#roles), [team ownership](/build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/examples.md#team-ownership-examples) and [users](/build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/examples.md#user-examples).

### Roles

There are 3 types of roles. Below are their out-of-the-box permissions:

| Role                         | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**                    | Perform any operation on the platform                                                                            |
| **Moderator** of a Blueprint | Perform any operation on a specific blueprint and its entities. A user can be a moderator of multiple blueprints |
| **Member**                   | Read-only permissions + permissions to execute actions                                                           |

:::info
The **Moderator** role is automatically created during blueprint creation.
For example, creating the blueprint `Env` will generate a role named `Env-moderator`, which can perform any operation on the `Env` blueprint and its entities.
:::

### Hierarchy

In addition to the permissions designated for each role, permissions are also inherited based on the following hierarchy:

**Admin** > **Moderator** > **Member**

For example, if **Members** are allowed to edit `Cluster` entities, then `Microservices` **Moderators** are also allowed to edit them (**Admins** can edit all entities under all blueprints).

You can view (and edit) each user’s role in the users table:

<img src="/img/software-catalog/role-based-access-control/permissions/usersPageRolesHightlight.png" width="70%" border='1px' />
<br/><br/>

Refer to the [Users and Teams](#users-and-teams-management) section for more information about the users page

## Users and Teams management

In Port, you can control and manage all your users and teams, in one place.

This allows admins to:

- Invite users to their organization and assign them specific roles and teams.
- Manage teams and their members.
- Promote ownership of assets within the organization (with team assignments).
- Set granular permissions on the portal (permission management).

It will also benefit developers, who could:

- Know what software assets they own and are responsible for.
- View and perform actions on their assets, according to their role and team.

Each user is defined by the following properties:

1. Basic information - image, name, and email.
2. Role - the user’s permissions level (see the [set catalog RBAC](/build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/set-catalog-rbac.md) section);
3. Teams - a `team` is a group of users that owns Entities (see the [team](#team-meta-property) section).

Users and teams can be managed via:

- The [Users & Teams page](#users--teams-page)
- Port's [Terraform provider](#terraform-provider)
- The [Port API](#port-api)

### Users & Teams Page

<img src="/img/software-catalog/role-based-access-control/users-and-teams/usersAndTeams.png" width="80%" border='1px' />

#### Users tab

In the users tab, you can:

- View all users.
- Invite new users.
- Edit users.
- Delete users.

#### Teams tab

In the teams tab, you can:

- View all teams.
- Create new teams.
- Edit teams.
- Delete teams.

:::tip Using SSO for users and teams

**Note:** the following limitations do not apply to teams created manually inside Port.

When Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled, users and teams information (including team membership) is taken directly from your identity provider (IdP).

Since those teams are synced from your IdP the following actions cannot be performed on them:

- Edit SSO team membership;
- Delete SSO teams.

If you try to perform one of the disabled actions, the interface will display an explanation:

![Managed by SSO notice](/img/software-catalog/role-based-access-control/users-and-teams/createTeamNoticeWithSSO.png)
:::

### Terraform provider

You can perform the aforementioned actions via the [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/port-labs/port-labs/latest).  
Here is a basic example of a `main.tf` file that defines a team with 3 users:

```bash showLineNumbers
resource "port_team" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  description = "example"
  users = [
    "user1@test.com",
    "user2@test.com",
    "user3@test.com",
  ]
}
```

You can browse the `team` schema [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/port-labs/port-labs/latest/docs/resources/port_team).

### Port API

The API allows you to manage [teams](https://api.getport.io/static/index.html#/Teams) and [users](https://api.getport.io/static/index.html#/Users).

### `Team` meta property

Each entity has a [meta-property](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/meta-properties.md) called `team`, that allows you to set which team owns the entity. As an admin, you can also set blueprint permissions according to this field.

Entity JSON example with `team` field:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "unique-ID",
  "title": "Entity Title",
  "team": [],
  "blueprint": "testBlueprint",
  "properties": {
    "prop1": "value"
  },
  "relations": {}
}
```

Team dropdown selector in the entity create/edit page:

<img src="/img/software-catalog/role-based-access-control/users-and-teams/teamPropertyMarkedInUIForm.png" width="70%" border='1px' />
<br/><br/>

| Field | Type | Description                                            | Default      |
| ----- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| team  | List | System field that defines the team that owns an Entity | `"team": []` |

- We support the manual creation of teams on Port, as well as integrating with identity providers, such as [Okta](/sso-rbac/sso-providers/oidc/okta.md) and [AzureAD](/sso-rbac/sso-providers/oidc/azure-ad.md), to import existing teams.
- When users log in to Port, their groups will be pulled automatically from their identity provider, and the allowed team values will be updated accordingly.
- It is also possible to configure [team inheritance](/build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/examples.md#team-inheritance) and utilize relations to auto-populate the `team` key of entities.

:::info
Okta and AzureAD integrations are only available after configuring SSO from the relevant identity provider, refer to the [Single Sign-On (SSO)](../sso-providers/) section for more details
:::

## Users and teams as blueprints

<BetaFeatureNotice />

Port allows you to manage users and teams as <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprints</PortTooltip>.  
This option is disabled by default, and can be [enabled via Port's API](/sso-rbac/rbac/#enable-the-feature). 

After enabling this option, two new blueprints will be created in your [data model](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) - `User` and `Team`.  
These blueprints represent Port users and teams, and their data will be synced accordingly:
- When you create a user/team <PortTooltip id="entity">entity</PortTooltip>, a matching Port user/team will be created as well.
- When you delete a user/team <PortTooltip id="entity">entity</PortTooltip>, the matching Port user/team will be deleted as well.  

The syncing mechanism is bidirectional, meaning that every create/edit/delete action performed on a user/team will be reflected in the entities as well.

#### Why manage users and teams as blueprints?

With this powerful feature you can accomplish the following:

1. Enrich your users and teams data by adding *properties* to these blueprints - Slack URLs, titles, profiles, or any other data.
2. Enrich your users and teams data by adding *relations* to these blueprints - for example, you can relate a user to a domain, or a team to a project.
3. As with all other blueprints, you can ingest data into your entities using an integration. For example, you can map your GitHub users into Port users via your GitHub integration configuration.

:::info Important
The `User` and `Team` blueprints cannot be deleted or edited, and their default properties cannot be changed.  
You can, however, create new properties and relations in them and edit/delete them as you wish.
:::

#### Enable option

To enable management of users and teams as blueprints, send a `POST` request to a designated endpoint:

:::tip To obtain your bearer token:

1. Go to your [Port application](https://app.getport.io), click on the `...` button in the top right corner, and select `Credentials`. 
2. Click on the `Generate API token` button, and copy the generated token.
:::

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints/system/user-and-team' \
-H 'Authorization: <YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN>'
```

<PortApiRegion />

#### Blueprints Structure

The new blueprints have the following structure:
<Tabs groupId="user-and-team-blueprint-structure" queryString values={[
{label: "User", value: "user"},
{label: "Team", value: "team"},
]}>

<TabItem value="user">
- Identifier - the user's email. Will be synced with the Port user's email.
- Title - the user's name. This will be synced with the Port user's first and last name.
- Status - the user's status, which can be one of the following:
  - Active - the user has logged into Port .
  - Invited - the user was invited to Port via an invitation email.
  - Disabled - the user is disabled and cannot use Port (relevant only for [service accounts](/sso-rbac/rbac/#service-accounts)).
- Port Role - the user's internal [role in Port](/sso-rbac/rbac/#roles). This property affects the permissions granted to this user.
- Moderated Blueprints - the blueprints that can be moderated by the user. Only relevant for `moderator` users.
- Port type - the type of the user, can be one of the following:
  - Standard - human users.
  - [Service Account](/sso-rbac/rbac/#service-accounts).
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="team">
- Identifier - the team's identifier.
- Title - the team's name. This will be synced with the Port team name.
- Description - the team's description. This will be synced with the Port team description.
- Size - the number of users in the team.
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Consequent changes

After enabling this feature, some functionalities will be affected:

- Any search query that includes `$team` will use the team's `identifier` instead of its `name`.  
  For example:
  ```json
  {
    "operator": "containsAny",
    "property": "$team",
     "value": ["team-identifier"] // instead of ["team-name"]
  }
  ```
  This change will affect all search queries that include the `$team` property, in any component (widget filters, entity search, dynamic permissions, etc.).  
  **Note** that the [getUserTeams()](/search-and-query/#dynamic-properties) function will automatically return the team's `identifier`, so it can be used as is.

- In [Advanced input configurations](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/setup-ui-for-action/advanced-form-configurations) of self-service actions, when using a [jqQuery](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/setup-ui-for-action/advanced-form-configurations#filter-the-dropdowns-available-options-based-on-properties-of-the-user-that-executes-the-action), team identifiers should be used instead of team names.  
  Also, when using `.user` in the jqQuery, you have access any of the user's properties and/or relations.  
  For example:
  ```json showLineNumbers
  {
    "properties": {
      "namespace": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "entity",
        "blueprint": "namespace",
        "dataset": {
          "combinator": "and",
          "rules": [
            {
              "property": "$team",
              "operator": "containsAny",
              "value": {
                "jqQuery": "[.user.relations.teams[].identifier]" // instead of [.user.teams[].name]
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- In [dynamic permissions](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/set-self-service-actions-rbac/dynamic-permissions) of self-service actions, under the `rules` and/or `conditions` keys, you can access the entire user object, including its properties and relations.  
  For example:
  ```json showLineNumbers
  {
    "policy": {
      "queries": {
        "search_entity": {
          "rules": [
            {
              "value": "service",
              "operator": "=",
              "property": "$blueprint"
            },
            {
              "value": "{{ .inputs.name }}",
              "operator": "=",
              "property": "$identifier"
            }
          ],
          "combinator": "and"
        }
      },
      "conditions": [
        // highlight-next-line
        ".user.properties.role == \"Manager\""
      ]
    }
  }
  ``` 

## Service Accounts

Service accounts are non-human users (bots) that can be used for integrating external tools and automating daily tasks using Port. <br/> For example - creating a Slack bot that can execute Port [self service actions](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/).

### Create a service account
:::info API-only and Users and Teams required 
Creating service accounts requires enabling [Users and Teams as blueprints](/sso-rbac/rbac/#users-and-teams-as-blueprints), and 
is currently only available via Port's API.
:::
To create a new service account, all you need to do is create a new user entity using the [Create Entity API](/api-reference/create-an-entity) endpoint with the value of `Service Account` in the `port_type` property.<br/>
Creating a service account has two limitations:
1. The new service account email domain must be `serviceaccounts.getport.io`.
For example `my-new-service-account@serviceaccounts.getport.io`
2. The `status` property of the new service account must be `Active`.

<details>
<summary><b>Full example (click to expand)</b></summary>
```bash
curl -L -X POST 'https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints/_user/entities' \
-d '{
    "identifier": "my-new-service-account@serviceaccounts.getport.io",
    "title": "My New Service Account",
    "blueprint": "_user",
    "icon": "User",
    "properties": {
        "port_type": "Service Account",
        "port_role": "Member",
        "status": "Active"
    },
    "relations": {}
}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <YOUR API TOKEN>'

```
</details>

### Using The Service Account
When creating a new service account entity you might notice a new section in the response body named `additional_data`. Inside this section you can find the new service account credentials you can use to authenticate against Port's API.
:::warning Sensitive credentials
These credentials will not appear anywhere else. Make sure you keep it in a secure place and share them only with people in your organization.
:::
To use Port's API with the new service account, you can generate an API access token with the credentials using the [Create Access Token API](/api-reference/create-an-access-token) endpoint.
With the generated token you can use any of the API endpoints as the new service account.

<details>
<summary><b>Full response (click to expand)</b></summary>
```json
{
    "ok": true,
    "entity": {
        "identifier": "my-new-service-account@serviceaccounts.getport.io",
        "title": "My New Service Account",
        "icon": "User",
        "blueprint": "_user",
        "team": [],
        "properties": {
            "port_type": "Service Account",
            "port_role": "Member",
            "status": "Active"
        },
        "relations": {},
        "createdAt": "2024-09-21T08:56:38.062Z",
        "createdBy": "",
        "updatedAt": "2024-09-21T08:56:38.062Z",
        "updatedBy": ""
    },,
    "additionalData": {
        "credentials": {
            "clientId": "<YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT CLIENT ID>",
            "clientSecret": "<YOUR SERVICE ACCOUNT CLIENT SECRET>"
        }
    }
}
```
</details>

### Service account permissions
Port service accounts are treated like any other users and extend the same RBAC mechanism. This means that you can define roles for them (Member, Admin, etc.) or add them to teams and they will be granted the relevant permissions accordingly. 

### Disabling service accounts
Service accounts can easily be disabled at any time. To disable a service account, update it's `status` property to `Disabled`.
Disabled service accounts can no longer generate new API tokens or use existing ones. Disabled service accounts can be re-enabled at any time by updating the `status` property back to `Active`.
