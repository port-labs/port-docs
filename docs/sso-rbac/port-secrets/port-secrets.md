# Port secrets

Port provides a secure way to store sensitive data, such as tokens, passwords, and other secrets used in different Port components. 

Port secrets can be used in:
- Port-hosted integrations - any integration that is installed using the "Hosted by Port" method, for example: [Datadog](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/apm-alerting/datadog?installation-methods=hosted-by-port&deploy=argocd&cicd-method=github#installation).
- [Self-service actions payload](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/setup-the-backend/#define-the-actions-payload).
- [Automations payload](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/setup-action#define-the-payload).

## Usage

To create a new secret:

1. In your [Port application](https://app.getport.io), click on the `...` button in the top right corner, and select `Credentials`.

2. In the `Credentials` window, choose the `Secrets` tab.

3. Click on the `+ Secret` button.

:::info One-time view
After creating a secret, you will be able to view its value only once.  
Afterwards, you will be able to delete the secret or edit its value, but not to view it.

## Security

- Port secrets reside in Port's infrastructure (hosted on AWS), **per organization**, meaning that no other organization has any access to your secrets.
- Secrets are `AES-256` encrypted at rest, and are only decrypted when needed.
- Secrets are encrypted in transit using `TLS 1.2`.
