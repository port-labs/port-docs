# üîê Set Catalog RBAC

Port provides granular control to make sure every user sees only the parts of the catalog that are relevant for them.

Port's catalog RBAC capabilities are enabled by Port's [permissions controls](../../sso-rbac/rbac/rbac.md).

:::tip

In order to manage who can view which pages in Port, check out [page permissions](../../customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/tutorial.md#page-permissions).

## üí° Common Catalog RBAC usage

Catalog RBAC allows admins to finely control which users have access to which information from the catalog, for example:

- Show developers only the services that they owns;
- Allow a user to edit just a specific property on an entity;
- Create a fully read-only view for a developer;
- etc.

## Set access controls to catalog data

The default permissions assigned to every blueprint upon creation specify that users with the admin role, and users with the specific blueprint moderator role, can perform any action over a blueprint.

It is also possible to assign more granular permissions controls on **entities**:

<Tabs groupId="permission" defaultValue="create" values={[
{label: "Create (register)", value: "create"},
{label: "Update", value: "update"},
{label: "Delete (unregister)", value: "delete"}
]}>

<TabItem value="create">

To assign permissions to create an entity, give the desired persona permissions under the `register` object as shown below:

<Tabs groupId="target" defaultValue="role" values={[
{label: "Role", value: "role"},
{label: "User", value: "user"},
{label: "Team", value: "team"},
{label: "Ownership", value: "ownership"}
]}>

<TabItem value="role">

To give create permissions to another role, add it to the `roles` array:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "entities": {
    ... other permissions
    "register": {
      // highlight-next-line
      "roles": ["my-blueprint-moderator", "Admin", "my-role"], // added my-role
      "users": [],
      "teams": [],
      "ownedByTeam": false
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="user">

To give create permissions to another user, add it to the `users` array:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "entities": {
    ... other permissions
    "register": {
      "roles": ["my-blueprint-moderator", "Admin"],
      // highlight-next-line
      "users": ["my-user@example.com"], // added my-user@example.com
      "teams": [],
      "ownedByTeam": false
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="team">

To give create permissions to another team, add it to the `teams` array:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "entities": {
    ... other permissions
    "register": {
      "roles": ["my-blueprint-moderator", "Admin"],
      "users": [],
      // highlight-next-line
      "teams": ["my-team"], // added my-team
      "ownedByTeam": false
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ownership">

To give create permissions to members of the owning team of an entity, change the `ownedByTeam` key:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "entities": {

      "users": [],
      "teams": [],

## Software catalog RBAC examples

Refer to the [examples](./examples.md) page for practical examples of Port's RBAC.

## FAQ

Since the catalog RBAC can be very granular, in some instances it might not be perfectly clear what the resulting assigned permissions would do, this part aims to provide some real-world examples and the behavior of Port's RBAC in those instances:

### What happens if a user lacks the permissions to edit a required property of the blueprint?

If the user has permissions to edit any property, except for a required property of the blueprint - then the user will not be able to register or update entities as a whole because they can't provide a value for the required property;

### What happens if the `ownedByTeam` setting is enabled for entity registration, but the user can't edit the `team` property?

If the `ownedByTeam` setting is enabled for registration, and the user does not have permissions to edit the `team` property - then the user will not be able to register a new entity since they can't select a value for his team field and mark it as owned by their team.
