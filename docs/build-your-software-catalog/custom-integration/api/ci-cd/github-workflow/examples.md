# Examples

## Import Gradle dependencies

[This GitHub repository](https://github.com/matarpeles/extract-gradle-plugins-example) contains an implementation of a workflow that uses Port's GitHub action and a supporting Python script to import [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) dependencies into Port.  

The workflow achieves the following:

- Extract plugins and their versions from a Gradle build file.
- Map the extracted plugins as package entities in Port.
- Automatically create or update a service entity in Port, connecting it to its plugin dependencies.

See the [repository](https://github.com/matarpeles/extract-gradle-plugins-example) for the full implementation and a detailed README describing how to use it.

## Basic create/update example

In this example you will create blueprints for `ciJob` and `image` entities, and a relation between them. Using Port's GitHub action you will create new entities every time the GitHub workflow runs:

<ExampleImageBlueprint />

<ExampleCiJobBlueprint />

After creating the blueprints, you can add the following snippet to your GitHub workflow `yml` file to create the `ciJob` entity in your GitHub workflow:

```yaml showLineNumbers
- uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
  with:
    clientId: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
    clientSecret: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
    baseUrl: https://api.getport.io
    operation: UPSERT
    identifier: new-cijob-run
    icon: GithubActions
    blueprint: ciJob
    properties: |
      {
        "commitHash": "${{ env.GITHUB_SHA }}",
        "jobBranch": "${{ env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL }}/${{ env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY }}/tree/${{ env.GITHUB_REF_NAME }}",
        "runLink": "${{ env.GITHUB_SERVER_URL }}/${{ env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY }}/actions/runs/${{ env.GITHUB_RUN_ID }}",
        "triggeredBy": "${{ env.GITHUB_ACTOR }}"
      }
```

<PortApiRegionTip/>

:::tip
For security reasons it is recommended to save the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` as [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), and access them as shown in the example above.

## Basic get example

The following example gets the `ciJob` entity from the previous example. This can be useful if your CI process needs to reference data from the ciJob (for example, the user who triggered the last job) when deploying the latest version of your service.

Add the following jobs to your GitHub workflow `yml` file:

```yaml showLineNumbers
get-entity:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    entity: ${{ steps.port-github-action.outputs.entity }}
  steps:
    - id: port-github-action
      uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
      with:
        clientId: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
        clientSecret: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
        baseUrl: https://api.getport.io
        operation: GET
        identifier: new-cijob-run
        blueprint: ciJob

use-entity:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: get-entity
  steps:
    - run: echo '${{needs.get-entity.outputs.entity}}' | jq .properties.triggeredBy
```

<PortApiRegionTip/>

The first job `get-entity`, uses the GitHub action to get the `new-cijob-run` entity.
The second job `use-entity`, uses the output from the first job, and prints the `triggeredBy` property of the entity.

## Relation example

The following example adds an `image` entity, in addition to the `ciJob` entity shown in the previous example. The `image` entity represents an artifact generated by the ciJob run.

Add the following snippet to your GitHub workflow `yml` file:

```yaml showLineNumbers
- uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
  with:
    clientId: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
    clientSecret: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
    baseUrl: https://api.getport.io
    operation: UPSERT
    identifier: example-image
    title: Example Image
    icon: Docker
    blueprint: image
    properties: |
      {
        "imageTag": "v1",
        "synkHighVulnerabilities": "0",
        "synkMediumVulnerabilities": "0",
        "gitRepoUrl": "https://github.com/my-org/my-cool-repo",
        "imageRegistry": "docker.io/cool-image",
        "size": "0.71",
        "unitTestCoverage": "20",
        "unitTestCoverage": "50",
      }
```

<PortApiRegionTip/>

All that’s left is to map the new `image` entity to the `ciJob` , thus making it possible to know which image was created by the ciJob.

```yaml
- uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
  with:
    clientId: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
    clientSecret: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
    baseUrl: https://api.getport.io
    operation: UPSERT
    identifier: new-cijob-run
    icon: GithubActions
    blueprint: ciJob
    relations: |
      {
        "image": ["example-image"]
      }
```

That's it! The entities are updated and visible in the UI.

## Basic update run example

In this example you will create a self-service action that deploys the latest version of your service, and updates the action run with the deployment status.

Add the following action to your `image` blueprint actions:

<ExampleCiAction/>

:::info
The example here is meant to show a common flow when using a Port self-service action and then using Port's GitHub action to update its logs, status and other information.

In order to use Port's GitHub action to make these updates, you will need your backend to either be a GitHub workflow or for a different backend of your choosing to trigger a GitHub workflow as part of its logic
:::

After triggering the action in Port, a new action run will be created in Port (and a matching `runId` will be generated). The runId can be used to update the action status and reports logs to Port.

To update the new self-service action run, add the following snippet to your GitHub workflow `yml` file (note you will need to pass the correct `runId` to the action):

```yaml showLineNumbers
- uses: port-labs/port-github-action@v1
  with:
    clientId: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}
    clientSecret: ${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}
    baseUrl: https://api.getport.io
    operation: PATCH_RUN
    runId: ${{ env.PORT_RUN_ID }}
    icon: GithubActions
    status: "SUCCESS"
    logMessage: "Deployment completed successfully"
```

<PortApiRegionTip/>

:::tip
The example above shows how to update the status and add a new log message to the action run, but it is also possible to update just a specific field of an action run.

For example it is possible to trigger the GitHub action and just update the log, without changing its status.

Note that once a Port action run has a status, it can no longer be updated and changes made to the catalog can no longer be tied to that action, so it is considered a best practice to update the status of an action only when it has finished performing all of its catalog changes and logic
:::

That's it! The action status and logs are updated in Port.
