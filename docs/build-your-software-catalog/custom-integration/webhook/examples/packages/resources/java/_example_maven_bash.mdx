:::note

- The script utilizes the `mapfile` command, which is a built-in command in the Bash shell, to read lines from the `pom.xml` file and store them in an array. Please note that this command may not be available in all shells by default. If you are using a different shell such as Dash or Zsh, you may need to switch to Bash or modify the script to achieve a similar functionality.
- The script relies on the `jq` command for manipulating JSON data. It is used to create JSON objects based on the package details extracted from the `go.mod` file and append these objects to an output JSON file. It is important to note that `jq` is a powerful JSON processor for the command-line, but it is not typically included in many systems by default. You may need to install it separately to use it.
