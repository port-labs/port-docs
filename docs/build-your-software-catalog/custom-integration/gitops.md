# Integrate assets using GitOps

Port allows you to use Gitops to manage Port entities, making your code repositories the source of truth for the various infrastructure assets you want to manage.

You can use this approach to ingest microservices, projects, packages, libraries, and other assets into Port, and keep them up-to-date with your infrastructure.

To use Gitops with Port, head over to your desired Git provider:
