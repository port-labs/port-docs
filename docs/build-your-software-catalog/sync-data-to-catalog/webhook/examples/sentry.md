# Sentry

In this example you are going to create a webhook integration between [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and Port, which will ingest comment entities.

## Prerequisites

Create the following blueprint definitions and webhook configuration:

<details>

<summary>Sentry comment blueprint</summary>
<SentryCommentsBlueprint/>

</details>

<details>

<summary>Sentry comment webhook configuration</summary>
<SentryCommentsConfiguration/>

</details>

:::tip
We have left out the `secret` field from the security object in the webhook configuration because the secret value is generated by Sentry when creating the webhook.
So when following this example, please first create the webhook configuration in Port. Use the webhook URL from the response and create the webhook in Sentry.
After getting the secret from Sentry, you can go back to Port and update the [webhook configuration](../webhook.md#configuring-webhook-endpoints) with the secret.
:::

## Create the Sentry webhook

1. Log in to Sentry with your organization's credentials;
2. Click the gear icon (Setting) at the left sidebar of the page;
3. Choose **Developer Settings**;
4. At the upper corner of this page, click on **Create New Integration**;
5. Sentry provides two types of integrations: Internal and Public. For the purpose of this guide, choose **Internal Integration** and click on the **Next** button
6. Input the following details:
   1. `Name` - use a meaningful name such as Port Webhook;
   2. `Webhook URL` - enter the value of the `url` key you received after creating the webhook configuration;
   3. `Overview` - enter a description for the webhook;
   4. `Permissions` - Grant your webhook **Read** permissions for the **Issue & Event** category;
   5. `Webhooks` - Under this section, enable the comments checkbox to allow Sentry to report comment events to Port;
7. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page.

:::tip
Now that the webhook is created, you can take the secret value generated by Sentry and use it to update the `security` object in your Port webhook configuration
:::

Done! any comments you make on an issue in Sentry will trigger a webhook event. Port will parse the events according to the mapping and update the catalog entities accordingly.
