# PagerDuty

In this example you are going to create a webhook integration between [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) and Port, which will ingest PagerDuty services and its related incidents into Port. This integration will involve setting up a webhook to receive notifications from PagerDuty whenever an incident is created or updated, allowing Port to ingest and process the incident entities accordingly.

## Import PagerDuty services and incidents

### Prerequisites

Create the following blueprint definitions:

<details>
<summary>PagerDuty service blueprint</summary>

<PagerDutyServiceBlueprint/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>PagerDuty incident blueprint</summary>

<PagerDutyIncidentBlueprint/>

</details>

Create the following webhook configuration [using Port UI](../../?operation=ui#configuring-webhook-endpoints)

<details>
<summary>PagerDuty webhook configuration</summary>

Remember to update the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the real secret you receive after subscribing to the webhook in PagerDuty.

1. Basic details:
   1. Title : `PagerDuty Mapper`;
   2. Identifier : `pagerduty_mapper`;
   3. Description : `A webhook configuration to map PagerDuty services and it's related incidents to Port`;
   4. Icon : `Pagerduty`;
2. Integration configuration:
   1. The JQ mapping;

<PagerDutyWebhookConfig/>

3. Scroll down to **Advanced settings** and input the following details:
   1. secret: `WEBHOOK_SECRET`;
   2. Signature Header Name : `X-Pagerduty-Signature`;
   3. Signature Algorithm : Select `sha256` from dropdown option;
   4. Signature Prefix : `v1=`
   5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

</details>

### Create the PagerDuty webhook

1. Go to [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) and select the account you want to configure the webhook for.
2. Navigate to **Integrations** in the navigation bar and click on **Generic Webhooks (v3)**.
3. Click **New Webhook** and provide the following information:
   1. `Webhook URL` - enter the value of the `url` key you received after [creating the webhook configuration](../webhook.md#configuring-webhook-endpoints).
   2. `Scope Type` - select whether you want to receive webhook events for a specific service (select `Service` if applicable) or for all services in your account (select `Account` if applicable).
   3. `Description` - provide an optional description for your webhook.
   4. `Event Subscription` - choose the event types you would like to subscribe to.
   5. `Custom Header` - enter any optional HTTP header to be added to your webhook payload.
4. Click **Add webhook** to create your webhook.
5. Alternatively, you can use the `curl` method to create the webhook. Copy the code below and run it in your terminal:

```curl showLineNumbers
  curl --request POST \
  --url \
 https://api.pagerduty.com/webhook_subscriptions
  --header 'Accept: application/vnd.pagerduty+json;version=2' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token token=<YOUR_PAGERDUTY_API_TOKEN>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data \
 '{
  "webhook_subscription": {
  "delivery_method": {
    "type": "http_delivery_method",
    "url": "https://ingest.getport.io/<YOUR_PORT_WEBHOOK_KEY>",
    "custom_headers": [
      {
        "name": "your-header-name",
        "value": "your-header-value"
      }
    ]
  },
  "description": "Sends PagerDuty v3 webhook events to Port.",
  "events": [
      "service.created",
      "service.updated",
      "incident.triggered",
      "incident.responder.added",
      "incident.acknowledged",
      "incident.annotated",
      "incident.delegated",
      "incident.escalated",
      "incident.priority_updated",
      "incident.reassigned",
      "incident.reopened",
      "incident.resolved",
      "incident.responder.replied",
      "incident.status_update_published",
      "incident.unacknowledged"
  ],
  "type": "webhook_subscription"
  }
  }'
```

:::tip
In order to view the different events available in PagerDuty webhooks, [look here](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/db0fa8c8984fc-overview#event-types)
:::

Done! any change that happens to your services or incidents in PagerDuty will trigger a webhook event to the webhook URL provided by Port. Port will parse the events according to the mapping and update the catalog entities accordingly.

## Import PagerDuty historical data

In this example you are going to use the provided Bash script to fetch data from the PagerDuty API and ingest it to Port.

The script extracts services and incidents from PagerDuty, and sends them to Port as microservice and incident entities respectively.

### Prerequisites

This example utilizes the same [blueprint](#prerequisites) definition from the previous section, along with a new webhook configuration:

Create the following webhook configuration [using Port UI](../../?operation=ui#configuring-webhook-endpoints)

<details>
<summary>PagerDuty webhook configuration for historical data</summary>

Remember to update the `WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the real secret you receive after subscribing to the webhook in PagerDuty.

1. Basic details:
   1. Title : `PagerDuty History Mapper`;
   2. Identifier : `pagerduty_history_mapper`;
   3. Description : `A webhook configuration to map PagerDuty Historical services and its related incidents to Port`;
   4. Icon : `Pagerduty`;
2. Integration configuration:

   1. The JQ mapping;
      <PagerDutyWebhookHistory/>

3. Scroll down to **Advanced settings** and input the following details:
   1. secret: `WEBHOOK_SECRET`;
   2. Signature Header Name : `X-Pagerduty-Signature`;
   3. Signature Algorithm : Select `sha256` from dropdown option;
   4. Signature Prefix : `v1=`
   5. Click **Save** at the bottom of the page.

</details>

<details>
<summary> PagerDuty Bash script for historical data </summary>

<PagerDutyScript/>

</details>

### How to Run the script

This script requires two configuration values:

1. `PD_TOKEN`: your PagerDuty API token;
2. `PORT_URL`: your Port webhook URL.

Then trigger the script by running:

```bash showLineNumbers
bash pagerduty_to_port.sh
```

This script fetches services and incidents from PagerDuty and sends them to Port.

:::tip
The script writes the JSON payload for each service and incident to a file named `output.json`. This can be useful for debugging if you encounter any issues.
:::

Done! you can now import historical data from PagerDuty into Port. Port will parse the events according to the mapping and update the catalog entities accordingly.
