# Install an integration

Port is designed to be flexible. It can be integrated with any tool, and can be used to build a software catalog that reflects your exact data model.

Port comes with a wide variety of available integrations for popular tools and platforms, modeled and configured by us to provide you with a plug & play experience.  

Once installed, you can customize and extend these integrations to fit your exact needs.

## Integration process

<img src='/img/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/integration_diagram.png' width='100%' border='1px' style={{ "borderRadius": "12px" }} />
<br/><br/>

Generally, installing an available integration results in the following:

1. The integration's default **data model** is created for you:
   1. Default <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprints</PortTooltip> will be created in the [Builder](https://app.port.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.
   2. Default [mapping](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping) will be defined in the integration's [data source](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page.

2. Data from the integrated tool is ingested into Port.  
   The sync mechanism and frequency depend on the installation method.

After the installation, you can customize the blueprints and/or mapping to ingest more/less data (see below).

## Installation methods

Below is a breakdown of the supported installation methods for Port integrations.  

| Installation type  | Security | Ease of installation | Periodic sync | Live sync (Webhook) | Infrastructure & maintenance responsibility | Use case fit |
| :------------------: | ---------|:--------------------:|:-------:|:-------------:| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| **Hosted by Port (OAuth)** | Port stores OAuth tokens securely. | üü©üü©üü©üü© | ‚úÖ<br/>(user-selectable interval) | ‚úÖ <br/>(Integration-dependent) | Port handles scaling, uptime, and updates. | Ideal for a quick setup with minimal effort. Mainly useful for getting started with an integration. Not recommended for large-scale production environments. |
| **Hosted by Port (Custom settings)** | Port stores API credentials securely. Setup requires more details (e.g., token, host) and allows access control flexibility. | üü©üü©üü©‚¨ú | ‚úÖ<br/> (user-selectable interval) | ‚úÖ <br/>(Integration-dependent)| Port handles scaling, uptime, and updates.| Best for quick setup without granting OAuth permissions. |
| **Self-hosted (Real-time)** | Managed entirely in your infrastructure. | üü©‚¨ú‚¨ú‚¨ú  | ‚úÖ<br/>(custom interval) | ‚úÖ <br/>(Integration-dependent) | You provision, monitor, and maintain the integration. | Best for high-security or custom networking needs.|
| **Scheduled (CI)**| Managed in your CI/CD environment. | üü©üü©‚¨ú‚¨ú | ‚úÖ (custom interval) | ‚ùå| Minimal infrastructure. You manage the CI/CD environment and triggers. | Best when real-time isn‚Äôt needed and you want full sync control. |


:::caution Integration Service Account Limitation
Service accounts (machine tokens) are currently not supported for Ocean integrations. This is a known limitation that affects:

- **Audit/event logging functionality** - Service account tokens may not properly log events.
- **Token validation** - Machine user tokens cannot be properly validated by the system.
- **Some integration features** - May experience reduced functionality.

**Current workaround**: Use personal or organizational credentials until this limitation is resolved.

**Status**: This is being tracked as a feature request and will be addressed in a future release. For production environments requiring service account support, consider using Port-hosted integrations where available.
:::

## Customize your integrations

Now that you've installed an integration, let's see how you can customize it:

1. [**Configure your data model**](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model) - Update the integration's data model in Port to ingest additional data that is not included by default.

2. [**Configure your data mapping**](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping) - Update the integration's data mapping in Port to match the data model and fetch your desired data from the tool.

## Entities

An entity is an instance of a [blueprint](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/), it represents the data defined by a blueprint's properties.

After installing an integration, a page will be created in your catalog, populated with entities representing the ingested data.

For example, once you complete Port's [onboarding process](/getting-started/overview) and connect your Git provider to Port, a new [Services page](https://app.getport.io/services) will be created in your software catalog, populated with entities representing your services (Git repositories):

<img src='/img/software-catalog/entitiesExample.png' width='75%' border='1px' />

<br/><br/>

Clicking on an entity in the table will take to its [entity page](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page), where you can view its properties, relations and more.

### Entity structure

By default, each entity has the following meta-properties: `identifier`, `title`, `team`. See the table below for more details.

#### JSON structure

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "unique-ID",
  "title": "Title",
  "team": [],
  "blueprint": "blueprintName",
  "properties": {
    "property1": "",
    "property2": ""
  },
  "relations": {}
}
```

## Monitoring and sync status

Every integration has a dedicated page that displays detailed monitoring metrics and sync status, helping you track the data ingestion process. This monitoring view is available for all Ocean integrations.

To access the integration's monitoring metrics and sync status, navigate to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page. Under the `Exporters` section, select your integration.  

The `Sync Status` tab offers a detailed overview of the data ingestion and reconciliation processes.  
It updates on initial installation, manual resyncs, and at scheduled intervals. Note that it does not reflect changes from **live events**.

It includes the following sections:  

### Sync by kind
Shows the monitoring metrics and sync status for each `kind`.  

 **Sync stages overview**:
      - **Fetch data**:  
        The first step in the data ingestion process is fetching the data from the data source.  
          In this section, you will find the following fields:
          - Fetched: Number of objects fetched from the data source.
          - Failed: If the fetch fails, this field will show `1` and `Fetched` will show `0`. Otherwise, it shows `0`.
      - **Map data**:  
        The next step is mapping these objects according to the integration's [mapping configuration](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping).  
          In this section, you will find the following fields:
          - Transformed: Number of objects that were mapped to blueprint entities.
          - Filtered out: Number of objects that were filtered out according to the mapping conditions.
          - Failed: Number of objects that failed to map, you can find more information about the failure reasons in the **Troubleshooting tips** section below in the UI or refer to the `Audit log` or `Event log` tabs, available in the same window.
      - **Ingest to Port**:  
        Final step is ingesting the mapped objects to Port.  
          In this section, you will find the following fields:
          - Ingested: Number of objects that were inserted or updated successfully.
          - Not changed: Number of objects that were already up to date, so no changes were made to them.
          - Failed: Number of objects that failed to ingest. To learn more about the failure reasons, see the `Audit log` or `Event log` tabs, available in the same window.
      
**Details**: Displays the duration of the sync.  

### Reconciliation
  This section provides visibility into both the reingestion and deletion processes.  

  When the `createMissingRelatedEntities` flag is set to `false`, Port will **not** automatically create related entities that are referenced in the mapping but not yet present in Port. The reingestion process ensures that once the missing related entities are ingested, the dependent entities will be reingested.  

  The deletion process ensures that entities that are no longer present in the data source are removed.  
    
  In this section, you will find the following data:  

  **Ingestion retry**:  
      -   Reingested entities: Displays the number of entities that were ingested successfully on retry after dependencies resolved.  
      -  Failed: Displays the number of entities that failed to reingest. 

  **Delete**: 
      -   Deleted entities: Displays the number of entities that were removed from Port to match the data source.
      -   Failed: Displays the number of entities that failed to delete.  
    
  **Details**: Displays the duration of the reconciliation.

  **Note**: The same data is also available through the [Get an integration's metrics and sync status](https://docs.port.io/api-reference/get-an-integrations-metrics-and-sync-status) API endpoint.

:::tip Prometheus Metrics Endpoint
If you are using the **self-hosted integration method**, you can get raw Prometheus metrics by accessing the following endpoint: `{your_integration's_base_url}/metrics/`.

<details>
<summary><b>Understanding the metrics (click to expand)</b></summary>

**Types of Metrics Available**
- **duration_seconds**: Measures how long it takes for a phase to complete.  
  _Labels_: `kind`, `phase`
