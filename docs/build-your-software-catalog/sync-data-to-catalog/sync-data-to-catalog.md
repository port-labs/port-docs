Port offers several integrations, allowing you to easily ingest and manage data with the tools you are already use in your infrastructure.

![Catalog Architecture](../../../static/img/sync-data-to-catalog/catalog-arch.jpg)

## Introduction

Port's integration methods allow you to ingest both [blueprints](../define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md#blueprint-structure) and [entities](#entity-json-structure).

By using Port's integrations you ensure that the software catalog is always up to date, and that live data is ingested directly from your systems, which is the most reliable source-of-truth for your environment.

## Creating entities

An entity is an object that matches the type defined by a blueprint, and it represents the data of the software components which is defined by the blueprint properties.

## Entity JSON structure

This is the basic structure of an entity:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "unique-ID",
  "title": "Title",
  "team": [],
  "blueprint": "blueprintName",
  "properties": {
    "property1": "",
    "property2": ""
  },
  "relations": {}
}
```

### Structure table

| Field        | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `identifier` | `String` | Unique identifier. <br /> Note that while the identifier is unique, it can be changed after creation.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `title`      | `String` | Entity name that will be shown in the UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `team`       | `Array`  | **Optional Field.** An array of the associated teams. <br /> Note that group permissions are handled according to this array, see [Teams and ownership](#teams-and-ownership).                                                                                         |
| `blueprint`  | `String` | The name of the [blueprint](../define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md) that this entity is based on.                                                                                                                                                |
| `properties` | `Object` | An object containing key-value pairs, where each key is a property **as defined in the blueprint definition**, and each value applies the `type` of the property.                                                                                                      |
| `relations`  | `object` | An object containing key-value pairs.<br /> Each key is the identifier of the [relation](../define-your-data-model/relate-blueprints/relate-blueprints.md) that is defined on the blueprint.<br /><br />See more in the [related entities](#related-entities) section. |

#### Teams and ownership

:::info teams and ownership
The `team` key defines ownership over an entity and controls who can modify or delete an existing entity.

To Explore more about ownership in Port see our [permissions](../../sso-rbac/rbac/rbac.md) section.

### Related entities

When two blueprints are connected, creating an entity of the `source` blueprint will show an additional option - a `relation`.

This option is shown under the `relations` section as follows:

#### Single relation example

When a relation between blueprints is configured with `many = false`, you can add a relation to an entity by adding the `relationIdentifier` as key, and the `relatedEntityIdentifier` as value:

```json showLineNumbers
"relations": {
    "relation-identifier": "relatedEntityIdentifier"
}
```

#### Many relation example

When a relation between blueprints is configured with `many = true`, you can add a relation to an entity by adding the `relationIdentifier` as key, and an array of `relatedEntityIdentifier`(s) as value:

```json showLineNumbers
"relations": {
    "relation-identifier": ["relatedEntityIdentifier1", "relatedEntityIdentifier2"]
}
```
