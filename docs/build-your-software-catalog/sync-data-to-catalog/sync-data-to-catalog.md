# Integrate Port with any tool

Port is designed to be flexible. It can be integrated with any tool, and can be used to build a software catalog that reflects your exact data model.

Port comes with a wide variety of available integrations for popular tools and platforms, modeled and configured by us to provide you with a plug & play experience.  

Once installed, you can customize and extend these integrations to fit your exact needs.

## Customize your integrations

Now that you've installed an itegration, let's see how you can customize it:

1. [**Configure your data model**](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model) - Update the integration's data model in Port to ingest additional data that is not included by default.

2. [**Configure your data mapping**](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping) - Update the integration's data mapping in Port to match the data model and fetch your desired data from the tool.
