# Integrate Port with any tool

Port is designed to be flexible. It can be integrated with any tool, and can be used to build a software catalog that reflects your exact data model.

Port comes with a wide variety of available integrations for popular tools and platforms, modeled and configured by us to provide you with a plug & play experience.  

Once installed, you can customize and extend these integrations to fit your exact needs.

We provide you with the required tools to model your data and ingest it with ease, see [`Create a custom integration`](/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration).

## Integration process

Generally, integrating a platform/tool with Port consists of 3 steps:

**The available integrations below take care of all of these steps for you, and can be customized after installation.**

## Customize your integrations

Now that you've installed an integration, let's see how you can customize it:

1. [**Configure your data model**](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model) - Update the integration's data model in Port to ingest additional data that is not included by default.

2. [**Configure your data mapping**](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping) - Update the integration's data mapping in Port to match the data model and fetch your desired data from the tool.

## Entities

An entity is an instance of a [blueprint](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/), it represents the data defined by a blueprint's properties.

After installing an integration, a page will be created in your catalog, populated with entities representing the ingested data.

For example, once you complete Port's [onboarding process](/quickstart) and connect your Git provider to Port, a new [Services page](https://app.getport.io/services) will be created in your software catalog, populated with entities representing your services (Git repositories):

<img src='/img/software-catalog/entitiesExample.png' width='75%' border='1px' />

<br/><br/>

Clicking on an entity in the table will take to its [entity page](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page), where you can view its properties, relations and more.

### Entity structure

By default, each entity has the following meta-properties: `identifier`, `title`, `team`. See the table below for more details.

#### JSON structure

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "unique-ID",
  "title": "Title",
  "team": [],
  "blueprint": "blueprintName",
  "properties": {
    "property1": "",
    "property2": ""
  },
  "relations": {}
}
```
