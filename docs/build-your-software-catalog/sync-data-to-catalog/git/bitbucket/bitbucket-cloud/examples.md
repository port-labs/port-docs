# Examples

## Mapping repositories, file contents and pull requests

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your Bitbucket projects, repositories, pull requests and files to Port. You will also see how to ingest folders from monorepo repositories and files from specific repositories:

<ProjectBlueprint/>

<MicroserviceBlueprint/>

<PRBlueprint/>

<PortAppConfig/>

:::tip

- Refer to the [installation](installation.md) guide to learn more about the `port-app-config.yml` installation process;
- We leverage [JQ JSON processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to map and transform Bitbucket objects to Port Entities;
- Click [Here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-workspaces/#api-workspaces-workspace-projects-get) for the Bitbucket project object structure.
- Click [Here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-repositories/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-get) for the Bitbucket repository object structure.
- Click [Here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-pullrequests/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-pullrequests-pull-request-id-get) for the Bitbucket pull request object structure.

After creating the blueprints and updating the mapping, you will see new entities in Port matching your repositories alongside their README.md file contents and pull requests.

## Mapping repositories and monorepos

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your Bitbucket repositories and their folders to Port. By following this example you can map your different repositories, packages and libraries from your monorepo into separate entities in Port:

<MicroserviceBlueprint/>

<PortMonoRepoAppConfig/>

## Mapping files

The following example demonstrates how to ingest files from a specific repository. You will be able to map files and file contents from specific repositories as entities in Port:

<FileBlueprint/>

<FileAppConfig/>

- Refer to the [GitOps](gitops/gitops.md) guide to learn more about using your repository as a source of truth for your software catalog;

## Mapping supported resources

The above examples show specific use cases, but Port's Bitbucket integration supports other use cases as well. To adapt the examples shown above, use the Bitbucket API reference to learn about the available fields for the different supported objects:

<BitbucketResources/>

When adding the ingestion of other resources, remember to add a entry to the `resources` array and change the value provided to the `kind` key accordingly.
