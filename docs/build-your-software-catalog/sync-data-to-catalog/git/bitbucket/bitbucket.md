# Bitbucket

Port's Bitbucket integration allows you to model Bitbucket resources in your software catalog and ingest data into them.

:::warning Deprecation Notice
This app will be deprecated in the future and support for the app will be discontinued soon.

To integrate Port with Bitbucket Cloud, we recommend using the [Bitbucket Cloud integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/bitbucket-cloud/).
:::

:::info Bitbucket Server (Self-Hosted)
This documentation covers Port's integration with **Bitbucket Cloud**. 
For information about integrating with Bitbucket Server (Self-Hosted), please refer to the [Bitbucket Server integration documentation](/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/webhook/examples/bitbucket-server/bitbucket-server.md).
:::


## Overview

This integration allows you to:

- Map and organize your desired Bitbucket resources and their metadata in Port (see supported resources below).
- Watch for Bitbucket object changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your software catalog.
- Manage Port entities using GitOps.

### Supported resources

The resources that can be ingested from Bitbucket into Port are listed below.  
It is possible to reference any field that appears in the API responses linked below in the mapping configuration.

<BitbucketResources/>


## Setup

To install Port's Bitbucket app, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Bitbucket app installation page](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1229886/port-connector-for-bitbucket?hosting=cloud&tab=overview).

2. Click `Get it now`.

3. Select your desired workspace and click on `Grant access`.

4. Once the installation has finished, you will be redirected to Port.


## Configuration

Port integrations use a [YAML mapping block](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping#configuration-structure) to ingest data from the third-party api into Port.

The mapping makes use of the [JQ JSON processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to select, modify, concatenate, transform and perform other operations on existing fields and values from the integration API.

To ingest Bitbucket objects, use one of the following methods:

<Tabs queryString="method">

<TabItem label="Using Port's UI" value="port">

To manage your Bitbucket integration configuration using Port:

1. Go to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page of your portal.
2. Under `Exporters`, click on your desired BitBucket organization.
3. A window will open containing the default YAML configuration of your BitBucket integration.
4. Here you can modify the configuration to suit your needs, by adding/removing entries.
5. When finished, click `resync` to apply any changes.

Using this method applies the configuration to all repositories in your Bitbucket workspace.

When configuring the integration **using Port**, the YAML configuration is global, allowing you to specify mappings for multiple Port blueprints.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Using Bitbucket" value="bitbucket">

To manage your Bitbucket integration configuration using a config file in BitBucket:

1. Go to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page of your portal.
2. Under `Exporters`, click on your desired BitBucket organization.
3. A window will open containing the default YAML configuration of your GitHub integration.
4. Scroll all the way down, and turn on the `Manage this integration using the "port-app-config.yml" file` toggle.

This will clear the configuration in Port's UI.

When configuring the integration **using BitBucket**, you can choose either a global or granular configuration:

- **Global configuration:** create a `.bitbucket-private` repository in your workspace and add the `port-app-config.yml` file to the repository;
  - Using this method applies the configuration to all repositories in your Bitbucket workspace (unless it is overridden by a granular `port-app-config.yml` in a repository);
- **Granular configuration:** add the `port-app-config.yml` file to the root of your desired repository;
  - Using this method applies the configuration only to the repository where the `port-app-config.yml` file exists.

When using global configuration **using Bitbucket**, the configuration specified in the `port-app-config.yml` file will only be applied if the file is in the **default branch** of the repository (usually `main`).

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info Important
When **using Port's UI**, the specified configuration will override any `port-app-config.yml` file in your BitBucket repository/ies.

## Capabilities

### Ingesting Git objects

By using Port's Bitbucket app, you can automatically ingest Bitbucket resources into Port based on real-time events.

The app allows you to ingest a variety of objects resources provided by the Bitbucket API, including repositories, pull requests and more. It also allows you to perform "extract, transform, load (ETL)" on data from the Bitbucket API into the desired software catalog data model.

The Bitbucket app uses a YAML configuration file to describe the ETL process to load data into the developer portal. The approach reflects a golden middle between an overly opinionated Git visualization that might not work for everyone and a too-broad approach that could introduce unneeded complexity into the developer portal.

After installing the app, Port will automatically create a `repository` blueprint in your catalog (representing a BitBucket repository), along with a default YAML configuration file that defines where the data fetched from BitBucket's API should go in the blueprint.



## Permissions

Port's Bitbucket integration requires the following scopes:

- `account`;
- `repository`;
- `pullrequest`.

:::tip Default permissions
You will be prompted to confirm these permissions when first installing the App.
