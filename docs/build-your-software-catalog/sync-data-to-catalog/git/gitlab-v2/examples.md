# Examples

## Mapping groups

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitLab groups, subgroups and projects to Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Group blueprint</summary>
<GroupBlueprint/>
</details>

<ProjectGroupBlueprint/>

<PortGroupsAppConfig/>

- We leverage [JQ JSON processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to map and transform GitLab objects to Port entities.

## Mapping projects, README.md and merge requests

:::caution Merge request access requirement
Merge requests are fetched at the **group level**. Ensure your integration token has access to the parent GitLab group that contains your projects. Project-level access alone is not sufficient for merge request visibility.

For more information, see the [troubleshooting](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/gitlab-v2/installation#troubleshooting) section.

:::


The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitLab projects, their README.md file contents and merge requests to Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Project blueprint</summary>
<ProjectBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Merge request blueprint</summary>
<MergeRequestBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Integration Mapping</summary>
<MergeRequestConfig />
</details>

### Merge request configuration options

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="parameter">

<TabItem label="States" value="states">

The `states` selector allows you to filter merge requests based on their state. You can specify one or more states to include in the sync.

Allowed values:
- `opened`: Merge requests that are currently open.
- `closed`: Merge requests that have been closed without merging.
- `merged`: Merge requests that have been merged.

By default, if not specified, only `opened` merge requests will be synced.

```yaml
  - kind: merge-request
    selector:
      query: 'true'
      # highlight-next-line
      states:
        - merged
        - opened
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Updated After" value="updatedAfter">

The `updatedAfter` selector allows you to filter merge requests based on when they were last updated. This helps you focus on recent changes and reduce the amount of historical data being synced.

The value represents the number of days to look back for merge requests. For example, setting it to `90` will only sync merge requests that have been updated in the last 90 days.

:::info Important
The `updatedAfter` parameter only affects merge requests that are not in the "opened" state. Open merge requests will always be synced regardless of their last update time.
:::

By default, if not specified, it is set to `90` days.

```yaml
  - kind: merge-request
    selector:
      query: 'true'
      # highlight-next-line
      updatedAfter: 90
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Mapping projects and issues

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitLab projects and their issues to Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Project blueprint</summary>
<ProjectBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Issue blueprint</summary>
<IssueBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Integration Mapping</summary>

## Mapping files and file contents

The following example shows how to ingest dependencies from a `package.json` file in your GitLab repository into Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Package blueprint</summary>
<PackageBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Integration Mapping</summary>
<PackageConfig />
</details>

The example will parse the `package.json` file in your repository and extract the dependencies into Port entities.  
For more information about ingesting files and file contents, click [here](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/gitlab-v2/#ingest-files-from-your-repositories)



## Mapping projects and monorepos

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitLab projects and their monorepo folders to Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Project blueprint</summary>
<ProjectBlueprint />
</details>


<MonoRepoAppConfig/>

To retrieve the root folders of your monorepo, you can use this following syntax in your `port-app-config.yml`:

```yaml
- kind: folder
  selector:
    query: "true" # JQ boolean query. If evaluated to false - skip syncing the object.
    folders: # Specify the repositories and folders to include under this relative path.
      - path: "/" # Relative path to the folders within the repositories
        repos: # List of repositories to include folders from.
          - backend-service
          - frontend-service
```

You can also specify a different path for each monorepo repository, for example:

```yaml
- kind: folder
  selector:
    query: "true" # JQ boolean query. If evaluated to false - skip syncing the object.
    folders: # Specify the repositories and folders to include under this relative path.
      - path: "apps/"
        repos:
          - gaming-apps
      - path: "microservices/"
        repos:
          - backend-services
```

You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Project blueprint</summary>
<ProjectBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Folder blueprint</summary>
<FolderBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Integration Mapping</summary>
<FolderConfig />
</details>

:::tip Folder mapping patterns
You can specify different paths for different repositories:

```yaml showLineNumbers
resources:
  - kind: folder
    selector:
      query: "true"
      folders:
        - path: "apps/"
          repos:
            - group/gaming-services
        - path: "packages/"
          repos:
            - group/shared-libraries
```

## Mapping members and group with members

### Prerequisites

- When using **GitLab Self Hosted**, an admin token is required, rather than a group access token, to retrieve the `primary email addresses` of members.
- When using **GitLab Enterprise**, accounts can retrieve the `primary email addresses` of members within their groups, provided the members are part of user accounts administered by an organization with [verified domains for groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/enterprise_user/#verified-domains-for-groups). For more information, see [limitations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/members.html#limitations).

:::caution GitLab free plan limitation
Primary email addresses are not available for GitLab "Free plan" users.
:::

### Mapping members

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitLab members to Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Member blueprint</summary>
<MemberBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary> Integration configuration</summary>
<MemberConfig />
</details>



### Mapping groups with members

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitLab groups and their members to Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and integration configuration:

<details>
<summary>Group with members blueprint</summary>
<GroupMembersBlueprint />
</details>

<details>
<summary>Integration Mapping</summary>
<GroupMembersConfig />
</details>

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="parameter">

<TabItem label="Include Bot Members" value="includeBotMembers">

GitLab allows the creation of tokens (bots) for automated tasks, which can be associated with groups or projects via access tokens.
The `includeBotMembers` parameter is used to filter out bot members from the actual GitLab members.
By default, this selector is set to `false`, which means the integration will only sync actual members.

```yaml
  - kind: group-with-members
    selector:
      query: 'true'
      # highlight-next-line
      includeBotMembers: false
```

```yaml
  - kind: members
    selector:
      query: 'true'
      # highlight-next-line
      includeBotMembers: false
```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
