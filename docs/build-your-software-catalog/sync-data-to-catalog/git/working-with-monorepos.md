# Working with monorepos

<br/>
After [connecting your Git provider](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/) to Port, Port will automatically create an <PortTooltip id="entity">entity</PortTooltip> for each repository in the organization in which you installed the integration.  

If you're working with a **monorepo** and would like to create an entity for each microservice in a single repository instead, you can do that by making an adjustment to your Git integration's mapping:

1. Go to the [data-sources page](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-sources) of your portal.
2. Under `Exporters`, click on the Git provider you would like to edit, for example:

<img src='/img/sync-data-to-catalog/monorepoDataSourcesExample.png' width='50%' />

<br/><br/>

3. A window will open with a YAML mapping of the integration.  
Use the following snippet as needed for your use-case (either add the `folder` entry to the `resources` array, or replace the entire YAML with it):

:::info Choose repos and folders to include
In the snippet below, change the `path` and `repos` fields to your desired values before copying.

4. Click on `Resync` to apply the changes.

5. Head back to your [catalog](https://app.getport.io/services), as you can see Port has now created an entity for each folder in the specified repositories, instead of creating an entity for each repository.
