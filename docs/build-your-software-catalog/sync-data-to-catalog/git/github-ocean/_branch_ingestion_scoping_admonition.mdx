:::tip Reduce API usage (branch ingestion scoping)
You can reduce API usage by scoping branch ingestion using one of the following selector options:

- `defaultBranchOnly: true`: Optional[Recommended]. Sync only the repository's default branch. When set, it takes precedence and `branchNames` will be ignored.
- `branchNames`: Optional. Use to ingest only specific branches by name (for example, only the default branch). When set, the integration fetches those branches explicitly instead of listing all branches using pagination.
