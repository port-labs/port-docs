# Installation

This page details how to install Port's GitHub integration (powered by the Ocean framework).

This page outlines the following steps:

1. How to [create](#create-access-token) an access token to give the integration permissions to query your Github organization.
2. How to [deploy](#deploy-the-integration) the integration in the configuration that fits your use case.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with permissions to create access tokens.
- Your Port user role is set to `Admin`.

## Setup

### Create access token

To allow Port to fetch data from your GitHub Organization, you need to create an access token. Port supports two types of tokens for authentication: personal access tokens and GitHub app installation tokens.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="pat" label="Personal Access Token (PAT)">

A Personal Access Token (PAT) is suitable if you're the only one managing the integration and don't need frequent credential rotation.  
To create a personal access token see Github's [managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

- The token must belong to a user with access to the relevant Github resources (e.g., repositories, teams).

<details>
  <summary>Required permissions</summary>
  
  These are the necessary permissions if you're creating a fine-grained PAT.
  
  **Repository permissions:**
  - **Content**: Readonly (For reading files)
  - **Metadata**: Readonly
  - **Administration:** Readonly (for syncing repository teams and collaborators)
  - **Pull Requests**: Readonly
  - **Issues**: Readonly
  - **Actions**: Readonly
  - **Code scanning alerts**: Readonly
  - **Dependabot alerts**: Readonly
  - **Deployments**: Readonly
  - **Environments**: Readonly
  
  **Organization permissions:**
  - **Members**: Readonly(for syncing users and teams)
  - **Administration**: Readonly(for syncing external identities)
  - **Webhooks**: Read and Write (for managing webhook)


:::note Default permissions
You will be prompted to confirm the above listed permissions when creating a personal access token.

Permissions can be given to selected repositories in your organization, or to all repositories.   
You can reconfigure the permission at any time, giving it access to new repositories, or removing access.

</details>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="github-app" label="GitHub App">

A GitHub App provides automatic access token rotation and is a good alternative to PATs.  
To set it up, see the [GitHub App installation guide](./github-app.mdx).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Configure parallel processing

Configure multiple workers to handle GitHub webhook events in parallel groups, preventing race conditions while maintaining event ordering for related resources.

Starting with Ocean 0.27, a new parameter was added to the configuration, which adjusts the number of async workers spawned for webhook events.

Set `event_workers_count: 4` in your config (default: 1) to enable parallel group processing.

When `event_workers_count > 1`, related GitHub events get grouped together:
- All PR events (opened, review, status) for PR #123 → same processing group.
- All issue events for issue #456 → same processing group.
- Push events grouped by commit SHA.

<details>
  <summary>Event grouping behavior</summary>
  
  **Supported event types:**
  - **Pull Requests**: Grouped by PR number (`pull_request`, `pull_request_review`, `pull_request_review_comment`)
  - **Issues**: Grouped by issue number (`issues`, `issue_comment`)
  - **Pushes**: Grouped by commit SHA (`push`)
  - **Releases**: Grouped by release ID (`release`)
  - **Workflow Runs**: Grouped by run ID (`workflow_run`)
  - **Status Checks**: Grouped by commit SHA (`status`)
  
  **Fallback**: If the event type isn't recognized, the payload will be scanned for the first `number`, `id`, or `sha` field.

:::note Processing guarantees
Events within the same group are processed sequentially to maintain order and prevent conflicts.
Different groups can be processed in parallel across workers.
With `event_workers_count: 1`, all events are processed sequentially using a simple queue.
