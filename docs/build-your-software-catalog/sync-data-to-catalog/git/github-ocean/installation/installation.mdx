# Installation

This page details how to install Port's GitHub integration (powered by the Ocean framework).

This page helps you choose an authentication method and then deploy the integration using the installation method that fits your setup.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with permissions to create access tokens.
- Your Port user role is set to `Admin`.

## Choose authentication method

<Tabs groupId="github-ocean-auth" queryString="auth">

<TabItem value="github-app-wizard" label="GitHub App (via Port)" default>

You can create and install a GitHub App directly from Port’s UI using OAuth. This is the recommended approach as it streamlines the entire setup process.

:::info Hosted by Port only
The **GitHub App (via Port)** setup is available **only** as a **Hosted by Port** installation.

**Hosted by Port** means Port runs and manages the integration for you (no Kubernetes/Docker/CI deployment on your side).

<TabItem value="pat" label="Personal access token (PAT)">

A Personal Access Token (PAT) is suitable if you are the only one managing the integration and you do not need frequent credential rotation.

::::info PAT authentication support
The GitHub integration supports authenticating with both **fine-grained** and **classic** PATs.
If you need **multi-organization** support (v3.0.0-beta+), use a **classic PAT** (fine-grained PATs do not support multi-org).
::::

To create a PAT, see GitHub’s [managing your personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

The token must belong to a user with access to the relevant GitHub resources (e.g., repositories, teams) across all organizations you want to sync.

You will use this token as the `githubToken` parameter when deploying the integration below.

<details>
<summary><b>Required permissions (click to expand)</b></summary>
  
This section focuses on the permissions you need to grant (fine-grained PAT vs classic PAT).

<h3>Fine-grained PAT</h3>

To configure permissions for a fine-grained PAT:

- Choose the **resource owner** (organization/user).
  <img src="/img/integrations/github-ocean/FineGrainedResourceOwnerSelection.png" alt="Selecting a resource owner when creating a fine-grained PAT" width="100%" border="1px" />

- Under **Repository access**, choose **All repositories** or **Only select repositories** (and select the relevant repositories).
- **Repositories permissions**:
    - **Actions**: Read-only.
    - **Administration**: Read-only (for syncing repository teams and collaborators).
    - **Code scanning alerts**: Read-only.
    - **Contents**: Read-only (for reading files).
    - **Dependabot alerts**: Read-only.
    - **Deployments**: Read-only.
    - **Environments**: Read-only.
    - **Issues**: Read-only.
    - **Metadata**: Read-only.
    - **Pull requests**: Read-only.
    - **Secret scanning alerts**: Read-only.
    - **Webhooks**: Read and write *(personal accounts only — required to create repository webhooks).*

    <img src="/img/integrations/github-ocean/FineGrainedPATPersonalAccountRepositories.png" alt="Choosing personal account repositories when configuring a fine-grained PAT" width="100%" border="1px" />

- **Organization permissions** (when the resource owner is an organization):
  - **Members**: Read-only (for syncing users and teams).
  - **Administration**: Read-only (for syncing external identities).
  - **Webhooks**: Read and write *(organizations only — required to create organization webhooks).*
    <img src="/img/integrations/github-ocean/FineGrainedPATOrganizationPermissions.png" alt="Choosing organization permissions when configuring a fine-grained PAT" width="100%" border="1px" />

- **Account permissions** (when the resource owner is a personal account):
  to grant the permissions below.
  - **Email addresses**: Read-only (only if you want to ingest user email addresses).
    <img src="/img/integrations/github-ocean/FineGrainedPATPersonalAccount.png" alt="Choosing account permissions when configuring a fine-grained PAT" width="100%" border="1px" />

<h3>Classic PAT</h3>

Select the following scopes for classic PAT:
   - `repo`
   - `repo_deployment`
   - `public_repo`
   - `security_events`
   - `workflow`
   - `read:org`
   - `admin:repo_hook` *(required if you intend syncing a personal account — used to create repository webhooks).*
   - `admin:org_hook`
   - `read:user`
   - `user:email`

<h2>Multi GitHub organization support</h2>

Starting from **version 3.0.0-beta**, the GitHub integration supports syncing data from multiple GitHub organizations when you use a classic PAT.


- **Supported authentication method**: Multi-organization support is available only when you authenticate using a **classic PAT**. Multi-organization syncing is **not supported** when authenticating via a **GitHub App** (including **GitHub App (via Port)** / self-hosted setups).
- **Multi-organization setup**: Set `organizations: ["org1", "org2", "org3"]` in your mapping.
- **All organizations setup**: If `organizations` is not specified, the integration syncs all organizations the classic PAT has access to.

<details>
<summary><b>Multi-organization mapping example (click to expand)</b></summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
deleteDependentEntities: true
createMissingRelatedEntities: true
enableMergeEntity: true
organizations:
  - org1
  - org2
# ... rest of your mapping (repositoryType, resources, etc.) ...
```

</details>

**Precedence:**

If `githubOrganization` is set in the environment variables or config and `organizations` are also listed in the Port mapping, the integration prioritizes single-organization behavior and syncs only the `githubOrganization`.

**Performance considerations:**

Syncing multiple organizations increases the number of API calls to GitHub and may slow down the integration. The more organizations you sync, the longer the resync time and the higher the API rate limit consumption.
