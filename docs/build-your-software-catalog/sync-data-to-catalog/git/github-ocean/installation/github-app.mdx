# Custom Github App

This page details how to install Port's GitHub integration using a custom [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/about-using-github-apps), which provides automatic access token rotation.

This page outlines the following steps:

1. How to [create](#create-a-github-app) a new app in your GitHub organization;
2. How to [install](#installing-github-app) the GitHub app in your GitHub organization and select repositories.
3. How to [deploy](#deploy-the-integration) the integration in the configuration that fits your use case.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account with permissions to create and manage GitHub Apps in your organization. This typically requires being an **Organization Owner** or having the **["App Manager"](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-programmatic-access-to-your-organization/adding-and-removing-github-app-managers-in-your-organization)** role.
- Your Port user role is set to `Admin`.

## Create a GitHub app

1. Navigate to your Github organization and click on Settings:

2. Inside the settings view, click on **Developer Settings** -> and then select **GitHub Apps**:

3. Click on "New GitHub App":

4. Insert the following properties:

- **GitHub App name:** Choose a unique name for the app. Note that GitHub App names must be globally unique.
- **Homepage URL:** https://port.io
- **Callback URL:** Leave this empty.
- **Setup URL:** Leave this empty.
- Uncheck **Active** under Webhooks. The [integration will automatically create the webhook if you configure the `OCEAN__BASE_URL`](#enabling-live-events) variable later during deployment.
- **Repository Permissions:**
  - Actions: Readonly (for syncing Workflows).
  - Checks: Readonly (for syncing `Port.yml`).
  - Contents: Readonly (for reading port configuration files and repository files).
  - Metadata: Readonly.
  - Pull Request: Readonly
  - Code scanning alerts: Readonly
  - Dependabot alerts: Readonly
- **Organization Permissions:**
  - Webhooks: Read and Write (to allow the integration create webhook).

Then select "Create GitHub App"

5. Go to the `Private keys` at the bottom of the `General` settings page:

![Generate Private key](../../../../../../static/img/integrations/github-app/SelfHosetdGeneratePrivayKey.png)

Keep the file, you will need it for the deployment step.

## Installing GitHub App

After you have the app registered in your organization, you can install it and select the repositories to integrate it with:

1. First, navigate to your organization and click on Settings:

![Org view](../../../../../../static/img/integrations/github-ocean/SelfHostedOrganizaionView.png)

2. Inside the settings view, click on Developer Settings -> and then select GitHub Apps:

![Settings view](../../../../../../static/img/integrations/github-ocean/SelfHostedOrganizationSettings.png)

3. Click `edit` on the GitHub app created at the step before:

4. Go to Install App -> and select the installation button on your wanted organization;

5. Choose the repositories you want the integration to be installed for:
