# Resource mapping examples


## Map repositories and pull requests

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitHub repositories, their README.md file contents and open pull requests to Port.  
You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and `port-app-config.yml`:

<RepositoryBlueprint/>

<PRBlueprint/>


<PortAppConfig/>

- Port leverages the [JQ JSON processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to map and transform GitHub objects to Port Entities.
- Click [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos#get-a-repository) for the GitHub repository object structure.
- Click [Here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request) for the GitHub pull request object structure.

:::

After creating the blueprints and committing the `port-app-config.yml` file to your `.github-private` repository (for global configuration), or to any specific repositories (for per-repo configuration), you will see new entities in Port matching your repositories alongside their README.md file contents and pull requests. (Remember that the `port-app-config.yml` file has to be in the **default branch** of the repository to take effect).

Additionally, you can configure your selector to limit the number of closed pull requests to ingest using a combination of `maxResults` and `since`. By Default, we only fetch 100 cloosed pull requests within 60 days.

```yaml
- kind: pull-request
  selector:
    query: "true"
    states: ["closed"]  # Specifically for closed PRs
    maxResults: 50  # Limit closed PRs to 50 capped at 300
    since: 60  # Fetch closed PRs within 60 days capped at 90 days
```



## Map repositories and branches

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitHub repositories and their branches to Port, you may use the following Port blueprint definitions and `port-app-config.yml`:

<RepositoryBlueprint/>

<BranchBlueprint/>

<PortBrAppConfig/>

## Map files and file contents

The following example demonstrates ingestion of dependencies from a `package.json` file in your repository into Port: 

<PackageBlueprint />
<PackageAppConfig />

The example will parse the `package.json` file in your repository and extract the dependencies into Port entities.

## Map Files and Repositories

The following example demonstrates mapping files to repository.

<RepositoryBlueprint />
<FileBlueprint />
<RepoFileAppConfig />

## Map repositories, workflows and workflow runs

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitHub repositories, their workflows and workflow runs to Port, you may use the following Port blueprint definitions and `port-app-config.yml`:

<RepositoryBlueprint/>

<WorkflowBlueprint/>

<WorkflowRunBlueprint/>

<PortWfWfrAppConfig/>

## Map repositories, Dependabot Alerts, and Code scan alerts

The following example shows how to ingest your GitHub repositories and their alerts (Dependabot and Code scan alerts) into Port. You can use the following Port blueprint definitions and `port-app-config.yml`:

<RepositoryBlueprint/>

<DependabotAlertBlueprint/>

<CodeScanAlertBlueprint/>

<PortRepositoryDependabotAlertMappingAppConfig/>

## Map repositories, deployments and environments

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitHub repositories, their deployments and environments to Port, you may use the following Port blueprint definitions and `port-app-config.yml`:

<RepositoryBlueprint/>

<RepoEnvironmentBlueprint/>

<DeploymentBlueprint/>

<PortRepoDeploymentAndEnvironmentAppConfig/>

## Map repositories, repository releases and tags

The following example demonstrates how to ingest your GitHub repositories, their releases and tags to Port, you may use the following Port blueprint definitions and `port-app-config.yml`:

<RepositoryBlueprint/>

<TagBlueprint/>

<ReleaseBlueprint/>

<RepositoryTagReleaseAppConfig/>

## Map supported resources

The examples above show specific use cases, but Port's GitHub integration supports the ingestion of many other GitHub objects.
To adapt the examples above, use the GitHub API reference to learn about the available fields for the different supported objects:

<GitHubResources/>

When adding the ingestion of other resources, remember to add an entry to the `resources` array and change the value provided to the `kind` key accordingly.
