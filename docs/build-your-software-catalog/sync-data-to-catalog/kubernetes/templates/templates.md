# Templates

To allow for a quick start when implementing Port's k8s exporter, custom pre-built templates were created. These configurations will map common use-cases for when working with kubernetes.

:::note

- Files used in the pre-built configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/tree/main/kubernetes)
- These use-cases are generic, and might not always fit your specific use-case. Achieving custom use-cases might require some extra configuration of the k8s exporter
