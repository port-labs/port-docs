# Quick starts

To allow for a quick start when implementation Port's k8s exporter, custom pre-built configurations were created. These configurations will map common use-cases for when working with kubernetes.

All pre-built configurations will be installed using Port's K8s [installation script](../installation-script.md).
:::note

- Files used in the pre-built configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/tree/main/kubernetes)
- These use-cases are generic, and might not always fit your specific use-case. Achieving custom use-cases might require some extra configuration of the k8s exporter
