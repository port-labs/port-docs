Port's K8s exporter installation script will assist you in the process of installing Port's K8s exporter template using
helm chart.

This script will help you with:

- setting up your custom Port [blueprints](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint);
- installing Port's k8s exporter using helm (check out the Helm
  chart's [source code](https://github.com/port-labs/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/port-k8s-exporter));
- deploying your custom [integration resources configuration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/kubernetes/kubernetes.md#exporter-configuration-structure)

:::tip
You can view the bash script [here](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/install.sh).

### General installation configuration

The script supports configuration via environment variables.

For each variable you'd like to set, run the following command before running the script:

```bash showLineNumbers
export {VARIABLE_NAME}={value}
```

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Default                                                                                    |

:::note

- **CLUSTER_NAME:** The script will set the cluster's name as the `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable. This name will be
  used as the cluster's name in integration resources configuration. If you'd like to change the cluster's name, you can do so by setting
  the `CLUSTER_NAME` environment variable before running the script.
- **CUSTOM_BP_PATH:** It is important to order the blueprints while taking in to account the necessary relations for
  each blueprint. Once a blueprint was created, attempting to recreate it using the script will fail. To recreate a
  blueprint using the script, first delete the blueprint.
