# Red Hat Openshift

[Red Hat Openshift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) is a versatile platform for scalable application development, modernization, and deployment over Kubernetes, offering a complete service set for app delivery on your preferred infrastructure.

Using Port's Kubernetes Exporter, you can keep track of important Openshift resources across your different clusters and export the data to Port. You will use built in metadata from your Openshift resources and CRDs to create entities in Port and keep track of their state.

## Mapping Red Hat Openshift - Goals

While Red Hat Openshift provides great visibility when it comes to your Openshift (Kubernetes) environments, there are still some questions that remain about how your Openshift environment connects and interacts with the rest of your infrastructure, for example:

- Which cloud provider is the cluster running in?
- Which VPC is the cluster running in?
- Who is on-call for a given cluster?
- What are all the endpoints provided by all different Openshift clusters in a cloud region?

Importing your Openshift resources to Port makes it easy to create multiple tailored views for different use cases. For example, you can create a view that shows you how your Openshift cluster interacts with the rest of your infrastructure, or you can create a high-level view that allows management to understand the business value provided by your Openshift installations.

In this example you will map your Openshift clusters, their workloads and the Openshift routes which are exposed by your different clusters.

## Prerequisites

## Setting up blueprints & resource mapping

The following section will guide you through the process of setting up your blueprints and resource mapping using the
installation script. You can read more about the installation script [here](#how-does-the-installation-script-work).

### Creating blueprints

The installation script provides a convenient way to create your blueprints. Using the `CUSTOM_BP_PATH` environment variable, you can fetch a pre-defined `blueprints.json` to create your blueprints. For this use-case, you will use [this file](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/blueprints/openshift-blueprints.json) to define your blueprints. Do this by running:

```bash showLineNumbers
export CUSTOM_BP_PATH="https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/blueprints/openshift-blueprints.json"
```

This `blueprints.json` file defines the following blueprints:

- Cluster
- Namespace
- Workload
- Service
- Openshift Route

:::note

- `Workload` is an abstraction of Kubernetes objects which create and manage pods. By creating this blueprint, you can avoid creating a dedicated blueprint per Workload type, all of which will likely look pretty similar.
  Here is the list of kubernetes objects `Workload` will represent:

  - Deployment
  - StatefulSet
  - DaemonSet

- `Openshift Route` is one of the most important Openshift resources, giving developers the capability to connect to their services, while the entire network layer is managed by the Openshift API, and providing a simple DNS record for accessability.

Below are the Openshift blueprint schemas used in the exporter:

  }
}
```

```json showLineNumbers

    }
  }
}
```
</details>

### Exporting custom resource mapping

Using the `CONFIG_YAML_URL` parameter, you can define a custom resource configuration to use when installing the exporter.

In this use-case you will be using **[this configuration file](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/full-configs/openshift_usecase.yaml)**. To achieve this, run:

```bash showLineNumbers
export CONFIG_YAML_URL="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/port-labs/template-assets/main/kubernetes/full-configs/openshift_usecase.yaml"
```

Below is the mapping for the Openshift resources:

<details>
<summary> <b>Service mapping (click to expand)</b> </summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
- kind: v1/services
  selector:
    query: .metadata.namespace | startswith("kube") or startswith("openshift") | not 
  port:
    entity:
      mappings:
        - identifier: .metadata.name + "-" + .metadata.namespace + "-" + env.CLUSTER_NAME
          title: .metadata.name
          icon: '"Service"'
          blueprint: '"k8sService"'
          properties:
            creationTimestamp: .metadata.creationTimestamp
            labels: .metadata.labels
            type: .spec.type
            selectors: .spec.selector // null

- kind: discovery.k8s.io/v1/endpointslices
  selector: 
    query: (.metadata.namespace | startswith("kube") or startswith("openshift") | not) and (([.endpoints[].targetRef.name]) as $ref | if $ref != [null] then true else false end)
  port:
    entity:
      mappings:
        - identifier: .metadata.labels."kubernetes.io/service-name" + "-" + .metadata.namespace + "-" + env.CLUSTER_NAME
          blueprint: '"k8sService"'
          relations:
            pods: .metadata.namespace as $namespace | ([.endpoints[].targetRef.name + "-" + .metadata.namespace + "-" + env.CLUSTER_NAME])
```
</details>

<details>
<summary> <b>Openshift route mapping (click to expand)</b> </summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
- kind: route.openshift.io/v1/routes
  selector:
    query: .metadata.namespace | startswith("kube") or startswith("openshift") | not 
  port:
    entity:
      mappings:
        - identifier: .metadata.name + "-" + .metadata.namespace + "-" + env.CLUSTER_NAME
          title: .metadata.name + "-" + .metadata.namespace + "-" + env.CLUSTER_NAME
          blueprint: '"openshiftRoute"'
          properties:
            hostname: .spec.host
            spec: .spec
          relations:
            service: .metadata.namespace as $namespace | [(.spec.alternateBackends[]?.name )]  as $alt_backends | ($alt_backends + [.spec.to.name]) | map(. + "-" + $namespace + "-" + env.CLUSTER_NAME)
```
</details>

You can now browse to your Port environment to see that your blueprints have been created, and your Kubernetes resources, including Openshift routes are being reported to Port using the freshly installed k8s exporter.
