# Map Your Complete K8s Ecosystem

Kubernetes has become one of the most popular ways to deploy microservice based applications. As the number of your microservices grow, and more clusters are deployed across several regions, it becomes complicated and tedious to keep track of all of your deployments, services, and jobs.

Using Port's Kubernetes Exporter, you can keep track of your K8s resources and export all of the data to Port. We will use K8s' built in metadata to create Entities in Port and keep track of their state.

:::tip
Get to know the basics of our Kubernetes exporter [here!](./kubernetes.md)
:::

## Prerequisites

- [Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the chart. Please refer to
  Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started;
- The `jq` command must installed
- The `yq` command must installed
- The `kubectl` command must be installed

The script will install the helm chart to the Kubernetes cluster which is currently in kubectl context.
To view the context name of the cluster the exporter will be installed on, run:

```bash showLineNumbers
kubectl config current-context
```

In this use-case, you will use a custom bash script which will assist you in the process of installing Port's K8s exporter. This will be done by fetching relevant files, setting up your Port [blueprints](../../define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/) and passing the necessary flags to the exporter's helm chart using the [installation](./kubernetes.md#installation) commands.

### Script configuration

The script supports configuration via environment variables

#### General installation configuration

| Environment Variable | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Default             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `TARGET_NAMESPACE`   | **Optional** - The Kubernetes namespace in which the exporter will be installed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `port-k8s-exporter` |
| `DEPLOYMENT_NAME`    | **Optional** - The Kubernetes deployment name the exporter will be installed as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `port-k8s-exporter` |
| `CLUSTER_NAME`       | **Optional** - The cluster's name as it will be exported to Port                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | `my-cluster`        |
| `CUSTOM_BP_PATH`     | **Optional** - The URL/path to a json file with an array of blueprint objects to create. Can be either a `https://domain.com/path/to/blueprint.json` format URL, or a local path to a file `envs/production/blueprint.json`. It is important to order the blueprints while taking in to account the necessary relations for each blueprint. Once a blueprint was created, attempting to recreate it using the script will fail. To do so, first delete the blueprint |                     |
| `TEMPLATE_NAME`      | **Optional** - A list of pre-made templates to install on top of the base `kubernetes_config.yaml` defined in the default `CONFIG_YAML_URL`. This parameter is only relevant if a custom `CONFIG_YAML_URL` was not configured. It adds the associated `.tmpl` files the can be found [here](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/tree/main/kubernetes) (example: `export TEMPLATE_NAME="template1 template2 template3"`)                                     |                     |

:::note
The script replaces all occurrences of the string `{CLUSTER_NAME}` from the `config.yaml` set in the `CONFIG_YAML_URL`([defined here](./full-kubernetes-exporter.md#helm-chart-installation-configuration)) with the value of the environment variable `CLUSTER_NAME`. This is useful for when creating a generic `config.yaml` which has no static cluster name.

Can be either an https format URL`https://domain.com/path/to/config.yaml`, or a local path to a file `envs/production/config.yaml` | `https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/kubernetes_config.yaml` |

## Setting up your Blueprints

### Creating Blueprints using the installation script

The [installation script](./full-kubernetes-exporter.md#k8s-exporter-installation-script) provides a convenient way to create your blueprints. Using the `CUSTOM_BP_PATH` environment variable, you can fetch a pre-defined `blueprints.json` to create your blueprints. For this use-case, you will use [this file](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/blueprints/kubernetes_complete_usecase_bps.json) to define your blueprints. Do this by running:

```bash showLineNumbers
export CUSTOM_BP_PATH="https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/blueprints/kubernetes_complete_usecase_bps.json"
```

This `blueprints.json` file defines the following blueprints:

- Cluster
- Namespace
- Node
- Pod
- Workload \*
- Service \*
- ClusterRole
- Role

:::note

- `Workload` is an abstraction of Kubernetes objects which create and manage pods. By creating this Blueprint, we can avoid creating a dedicated Blueprint per Workload type, all of which will likely look pretty similar.
  Here is the list of kubernetes objects `Workload` will represent:

* Deployment
* ReplicaSet
* StatefulSet
* DaemonSet
* Job

- `Service` uses selectors to route traffic to pods, which complicates mapping a `service` entity to it's `workload` entity. For simplicity, we will map `Service` to `Namespace`

:::

## Exporting your Kubernetes cluster

### Installing the Kubernetes exporter using the script

Now it is time to run the installation script and deploy Port's Kubernetes Exporter.
By default (unless a custom `CONFIG_YAML_URL` is set), the installation script fetches a `config.yaml` which has support for core k8s resources - Cluster, Namespace, Workload, Pod, Node.

If no custom `CONFIG_YAML_URL` is defined, you can use custom pre-built templates to add on to the `config.yaml` using the `TEMPLATE_NAME` environment variable. In this use-case you will be using the `complete_usecase` template. To achieve this, run:

```bash showLineNumbers
export TEMPLATE_NAME="complete_usecase"
```

Now you are ready to run the installation script:

```bash showLineNumbers
export CLUSTER_NAME="my-cluster"
export PORT_CLIENT_ID="my-port-client-id"
export PORT_CLIENT_SECRET="my-port-client-secret"
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/port-labs/template-assets/main/kubernetes/install.sh | bash
```

That's it! You can now browse to your Port environment to see that your blueprints have been created, and entities are being reported to Port using the freshly installed k8s exporter.

## Summary

In this use-case, using the installation script, you:

- set up your Port environment by creating blueprints defining different k8s resources;
- installed Port's k8s exporter with a configuration allowing you to export important data from your cluster;
- fetched k8s resources from you cluster as entities to your Port environment
