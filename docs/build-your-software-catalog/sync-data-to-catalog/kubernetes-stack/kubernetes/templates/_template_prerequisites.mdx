- This guide assumes you have completed the [visualize your services' k8s runtime guide](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/visualize-service-k8s-runtime/) 
- [Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the chart. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started
- The `jq` command must installed
- The `yq` command must installed
- The `kubectl` command must be installed
- Have your [Port credentials](/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/api/#find-your-port-credentials) ready.

In this use-case, you will use a custom bash script which will assist you in the process of installing Port's K8s exporter.

The script will install the helm chart to the Kubernetes cluster which is currently in kubectl context.
To view the context name of the cluster the exporter will be installed on, run:

```bash
kubectl config current-context
```
