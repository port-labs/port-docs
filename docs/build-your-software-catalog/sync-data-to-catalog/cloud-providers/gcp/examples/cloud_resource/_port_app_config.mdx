<summary>Mapping configuration for cloud resources</summary>
:::tip Cloud resource kind
The `cloudResource` kind is a generic kind that can be used to map most cloud resources.

The mapping requires passing the resource kind as a parameter inside the `resourceKinds` object.


It is possible that some of the kinds that you want to export are not in this example, head to the bottom of the page to see how to add them.
