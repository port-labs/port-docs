# Azure

Our integration with Azure provides the ability to export your Azure resources to Port, according to your configuration.
After the initial import of data, the integration will also listen to live events from Azure to update data inside Port in real time.

Our integration with Azure supports real-time event processing, this allows for an accurate **real-time** representation of your Azure infrastructure inside Port.

:::tip
Port's Azure exporter is open source, view the source code [**here**](https://github.com/port-labs/ocean/tree/main/integrations/azure).

## ðŸ’¡ Azure integration common use cases

Our Azure integration makes it easy to fill the software catalog with data directly from your Azure subscription, for example:

- Map resources from your Azure subscriptions, such as **AKS**, **Storage Accounts**, **Container Apps**, **Load Balancers** and other Azure resources.
- Watch for Azure object changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your entities in Port.
- Configure relations to other resources in your organization to create complete, easily digestible views of your resources and their relationships inside Port.

## Installation

The Azure exporter can be deployed in multiple ways, including Helm, ContainerApp, Docker and more.

Continue to the [installation](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/cloud-providers/azure/installation.md) guide to learn how to install the Azure exporter.

## Ingest Azure resources

The Azure exporter can retrieve all the resources supported by the [Azure Resource Manager REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/resources/resources/list), and export them to Port as entities of existing blueprints.
