:::note Prerequisites
To install and use Port's Terraform provider, you will need to install the [Terraform CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
:::

To install the Terraform provider, create a `.tf` file specifying the provider and the required Port [credentials](../../api/api.md#find-your-port-credentials):

```hcl showLineNumbers
terraform {
  required_providers {
    port = {
      source  = "port-labs/port-labs"
      version = "~> 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "port" {
  client_id = "{YOUR CLIENT ID}"     # or set the environment variable PORT_CLIENT_ID
  secret    = "{YOUR CLIENT SECRET}" # or set the environment variable PORT_CLIENT_SECRET
}
```

Then run the following command to install the provider in your Terraform workspace:

```shell showLineNumbers
terraform init
```
