### Configuration structure

The integration configuration determines which resources will be queried from {props.name}, and which entities and
properties will be created in Port.

<SupportedResources />

- The root key of the integration configuration is the `resources` key:

```yaml showLineNumbers
# highlight-next-line
resources:
  - kind: ONE_OF_THE_SUPPORTED_KINDS
    selector:
    ...
```

- The `kind` key is a specifier for a {props.name} object:

```yaml showLineNumbers
  resources:
    # highlight-next-line
    - kind: ONE_OF_THE_SUPPORTED_KINDS
      selector:
      ...
```

- The `selector` and the `query` keys allow you to filter which objects of the specified `kind` will be ingested into
  your software catalog:

```yaml showLineNumbers
resources:
  - kind: { props.customKind }
    # highlight-start
    selector:
      query: "true" # JQ boolean expression. If evaluated to false - this object will be skipped.
    # highlight-end
    port:
```

- The `port`, `entity` and the `mappings` keys are used to map the {props.name} object fields to Port entities. To create
  multiple mappings of the same kind, you can add another item in the `resources` array;

{props.children}

:::tip Blueprint key
Note the value of the `blueprint` key - if you want to use a hardcoded string, you need to encapsulate it in 2 sets of
quotes, for example use a pair of single-quotes (`'`) and then another pair of double-quotes (`"`)

### Ingest data into Port

To ingest SonarQube objects using the [integration configuration](#configuration-structure), you can follow the steps
below:

1. Go to the DevPortal Builder page.
2. Select a blueprint you want to ingest using SonarQube.
3. Choose the **Ingest Data** option from the menu.
4. Select {props.name} under the {props.category} category.
5. Modify the [configuration](#configuration-structure) according to your needs.
6. Click `Resync`.
