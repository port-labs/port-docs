Using this installation option means that the integration will be hosted by Port, with a customizable resync interval to ingest data into Port.

<h3>Installation</h3>

<Tabs queryString="oauth">
<TabItem value="oauth" label="OAuth">

This integration supports **OAuth2** for quick installation with default settings.

1. Go to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href={`https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources?section=EXPORTERS&provider=${props.integration}`}>{props.integration} data source page</a> in your portal.

2. Under `Select your installation method`, choose `Hosted by Port`.

3. Click `Connect`.  
   This will prompt you to authorize Port and install the integration with the following default settings:
    <OceanSaasDefaultSettings id={props.integration} />
   See the `Application settings` section below for descriptions of these settings.

Answers to common questions about OAuth integrations can be found here:
<details>
<summary>**OAuth integrations FAQ (click to expand)**</summary>

**What permissions do I need to install the integration using OAuth2?**

Any level of permission will work. However, the data fetched depends on the user's access level:
    - If the user has admin-level access, Port will fetch all project data.
    - If the user has restricted access (e.g., only specific projects), Port will fetch data based on those permissions.

**Are there any differences in the sync behavior between OAuth2 and custom token-based installation?**

Token-Based Installation requires users to manually generate and provide tokens, offering control over permissions but increasing the risk of setup errors.  
OAuth2 Installation automates the process, simplifying setup and reducing errors while aligning access levels with the user’s permissions.

**Can multiple integrations use the same OAuth connection? Can multiple organizations use the same OAuth connection?**

There is no limit to the number of OAuth connections you can create for integrations or organizations.

**What is the level of permissions Port requests in the OAuth2 authentication flow, and why?**

The exact permissions Port requests will appear when connecting the OAuth provider.  
Port requests both read and write access so the secrets can be used later for running self-service actions (e.g., creating Jira tickets).

**What happens if my integration shows an authorization error with the 3rd party?**

OAuth tokens are refreshed automatically by Port, including before manual syncs.  
If you encounter an HTTP 401 unauthorized error, try running a manual resync or wait for the next scheduled sync, and the issue will resolve itself. 
If the error persists, please contact our support team.

**What happens if I delete an installation of OAuth2?**

- Deleting an OAuth2-based installation will not revoke access to the third-party service.
- Port will delete the OAuth secret, which prevents it from utilizing the connection for future syncs.
- If you reinstall the integration, you will need to reconnect OAuth.
- Actions relying on the deleted secret (e.g., creating a Jira ticket) will fail until the secret is recreated or the integration is reinstalled.

To manually configure the installation settings:
1. Toggle on the `Use Custom Settings` switch.

2. Configure the `integration settings` and `application settings` as you wish (see below for details).

<h3>Application settings</h3>

Every integration hosted by Port has the following customizable application settings, which are configurable after installation:

- `Resync interval`: The frequency at which Port will ingest data from the integration. There are various options available, ranging from every 1 hour to once a day.

- `Send raw data examples`: A boolean toggle (`enabled` by default). If enabled, raw data examples will be sent from the integration to Port. These examples are used when [testing your mapping configuration](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping#test-your-mapping---jq-playground), they allow you to run your `jq` expressions against real data and see the results.

<h3>Integration settings</h3>

Every integration has its own tool-specific settings, under the `Integration settings` section:  
<OceanSaasIntegrationSettings id={props.integration} />

You can also hover over the ⓘ icon next each setting to see a description.

<h4>Port secrets</h4>

Some integration settings require sensitive pieces of data, such as tokens.  
For these settings, [Port secrets](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/) will be used, ensuring that your sensitive data is encrypted and secure.

When filling in such a setting, its value will be obscured (shown as `••••••••`).  
For each such setting, Port will automatically create a secret in your organization.  

To see all secrets in your organization, follow [these steps](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/#usage).

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<OceanSaasLimitations id={props.integration} />

<h3>Port source IP addresses</h3>

When using this installation method, Port will make outbound calls to your 3rd-party applications from static IP addresses.  
You may need to add these addresses to your allowlist, in order to allow Port to interact with the integrated service:
