Using this installation option means that the integration will be hosted by Port, with a customizable resync interval to ingest data into Port.

<h3>Live event support</h3>

Currently, live events are not supported for integrations hosted by Port.  
Resyncs will be performed **periodically** (with a configurable interval), or **manually** triggered by you via Port's UI.

Therefore, real-time events (including GitOps) will not be ingested into Port immediately.  
Support for live events is WIP and will be supported in the near future.

<h3>Installation</h3>

To install, follow these steps:

1. Go to the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href={`https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources?section=EXPORTERS&provider=${props.integration}`}>{props.integration} data source page</a> in your portal.

2. Under `Select your installation method`, choose `Hosted by Port`.

3. To install the integration using **OAuth with default settings**, click `Connect`.  
   This will prompt you to authorize Port and install the integration with the following default settings:
    <OceanSaasDefaultSettings id={props.integration} />
    
4. Alternatively, toggle on `Manual installation` to configure the `integration settings` and `application settings` yourself (see below for details).


<h3>Application settings</h3>

Every integration hosted by Port has the following customizable application settings, which are configurable after installation:

- `Resync interval`: The frequency at which Port will ingest data from the integration. There are various options available, ranging from every 1 hour to once a day.

- `Send raw data examples`: A boolean toggle (`enabled` by default). If enabled, raw data examples will be sent from the integration to Port. These examples are used when [testing your mapping configuration](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping#test-your-mapping---jq-playground), they allow you to run your `jq` expressions against real data and see the results.

<h3>Integration settings</h3>

Every integration has its own tool-specific settings, under the `Integration settings` section:  
<OceanSaasIntegrationSettings id={props.integration} />

You can also hover over the â“˜ icon next each setting to see a description.


<h4>Port secrets</h4>

Some integration settings require sensitive pieces of data, such as tokens.  
For these settings, [Port secrets](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/) will be used, ensuring that your sensitive data is encrypted and secure.

When changing such a setting, you will be prompted to choose an existing secret or create a new one:

<h3>Port source IP addresses</h3>

When using this installation method, Port will make outbound calls to your 3rd-party applications from static IP addresses.  
You may need to add these addresses to your allowlist, in order to allow Port to interact with the integrated service:
