Using this installation option means that the integration will be hosted by Port, with a customizable resync interval to ingest data into Port.

<h3>Live event support</h3>

Currently, live events are not supported for integrations hosted by Port.  
Resyncs will be performed **periodically** (with a configurable interval), or **manually** triggered by you via Port's UI.

Therefore, real-time events (including GitOps) will not be ingested into Port immediately.  
Support for live events is WIP and will be supported in the near future.

:::tip Self-hosted installation
Alternatively, you can install the integration using the [Real-time (self-hosted)](?installation-methods=real-time-self-hosted#setup) method to update Port in real time using webhooks.

<h3>Installation</h3>

To install, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page of your portal.

2. Click on the `+ Data source` button in the top-right corner.

3. Click on the relevant integration in the list.

4. Under `Select your installation method`, choose `Hosted by Port`.

5. Configure the `integration settings` and `application settings` as you wish (see below for details).

<h3>Application settings</h3>

Every integration hosted by Port has the following customizable application settings, which are configurable after installation:

- `Resync interval`: The frequency at which Port will ingest data from the integration. There are various options available, ranging from every 1 hour to once a day.

- `Send raw data examples`: A boolean toggle (`enabled` by default). If enabled, raw data examples will be sent from the integration to Port. These examples are used when [testing your mapping configuration](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping#test-your-mapping---jq-playground), they allow you to run your `jq` expressions against real data and see the results.

<h3>Integration settings</h3>

Every integration has its own tool-specific settings, under the `Integration settings` section.  
Each of these settings has an ⓘ icon next to it, which you can hover over to see a description of the setting.

<h4>Port secrets</h4>

Some integration settings require sensitive pieces of data, such as tokens.  
For these settings, [Port secrets](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/) will be used, ensuring that your sensitive data is encrypted and secure.

When filling in such a setting, its value will be obscured (shown as `••••••••`).  
For each such setting, Port will automatically create a secret in your organization.  

To see all secrets in your organization, follow [these steps](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/#usage).

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<h3>Port source IP addresses</h3>

When using this installation method, Port will make outbound calls to your 3rd-party applications from static IP addresses.  
You may need to add these addresses to your allowlist, in order to allow Port to interact with the integrated service:
