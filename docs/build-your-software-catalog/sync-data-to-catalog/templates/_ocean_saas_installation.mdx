Using this installation option means that the integration will be hosted by Port, with a customizable resync interval to ingest data into Port.

:::info Live event support
Currently, live events are not supported for integrations hosted by Port.  
Resyncs will be performed **periodically**, based on the `Resync interval` you have configured, or **manually** triggered by you via Port's UI.  

Therefore, real-time events (including GitOps) will not be ingested into Port immediately.  
Support for live events is WIP and will be supported in the near future.

To install, follow the following steps:

1. Go to the [Data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page of your portal.

2. Click on the `+ Data source` button in the top-right corner.

3. Click on the relevant integration in the list.

4. Under `Select your installation method`, choose `Hosted by Port`.

5. Configure the `integration settings` and `application settings` as you wish (see below for details).

<h3>Application settings</h3>

Every integration hosted by Port has the following customizable application settings:

- `Resync interval`: The frequency at which Port will ingest data from the integration. There are various options available, ranging from every 1 hour to once a day.

- `Send raw data examples`: A boolean toggle (`enabled` by default). If enabled, raw data examples will be sent from the integration to Port. These examples are used when [testing your mapping configuration](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping#test-your-mapping---jq-playground), they allow you to run your `jq` expressions against real data and see the results.

<h3>Integration settings</h3>

Every integration has its own tool-specific settings, under the `Integration settings` section.  
Each of these settings has an â“˜ icon next to it, which you can hover over to see a description of the setting.

<h4>Port secrets</h4>

Some integration settings require sensitive pieces of data, such as tokens.  
For these settings, [Port secrets](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/) will be used, ensuring that your sensitive data is encrypted and secure.

When changing such a setting, you will be prompted to choose an existing secret or create a new one:
