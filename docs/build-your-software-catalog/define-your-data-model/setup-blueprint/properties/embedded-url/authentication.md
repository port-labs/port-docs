# Authentication

With this feature, you can embed another website that's protected by SSO authentication.
To do this, you'll need the required parameters to create a JWT token.

## Authentication code flow + PKCE

The following diagram outlines the login scheme used to authenticate with your SSO and gain access to the private resource:

![AuthorizationCodeFlow.png](/img/software-catalog/widgets/embedded-url/AuthorizationCodeFlow.png)

Here is an explanation of the login flow:

1. The widget will generate a PKCE `code_verifier` & `code_challange`;
2. The widget URL is set to the `authorizationUrl` along with the `clientId` and the generated `code_challange`;
3. The widget will then be redirected to the SSO sign-in page;
4. The user will sign in using the SSO (If the user is already signed in to the SSO, this step will happen automatically);
5. The SSO sign-in page will redirect the widget back to https://app.getport.io with the authorization `code` as a URL hash parameter;
6. The widget will send the `code`, `clientId` and the `code_verifier` to the `tokenURL`;
7. The SSO will validate the PKCE code;
8. A response will come back with an access token;
9. The widget will pass the access token as a query parameter `auth_token={accessToken}` to the URL specified in the property value;
10. Your page should be displayed now!

## Required Parameters

To set up the authentication, you'll need the following parameters:

- `clientId`
- `authorizationUrl`
- `tokenUrl`

Here's an example of how to apply these parameters in your Blueprint:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "title": "Grafana",
  "type": "string",
  "format": "url",
  // highlight-start
  "spec": "embedded-url",
  "specAuthentication": {
    "clientId": "your-client-id",
    "authorizationUrl": "your-authorization-url",
    "tokenUrl": "your-token-url"
  }
  // highlight-end
}
```

## Examples

### Okta

<details>
<summary>Setup</summary>

**Steps:**

1. Follow the steps in [Okta's documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcodepkce/main/) to create an Application in your Okta Organization;
2. Make sure the Port host is in the `Redirect Uris`:
   1. Go to Applications -> The application you just created -> Login;
   2. Add `https://app.getport.io` as a Sign-in redirect URI.
3. Enable IFrame for Sign-In Page:
   1. Go to Customizations -> Other;
   2. Scroll to "IFrame Embedding" and enable it.

your Okta setup.

Based on Grafana docs for [JWT Configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/jwt/) & [OAuth Configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/generic-oauth/)

```ini showLineNumbers

jwk_set_url = https://{your-okta-org}.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys

api_url = https://{your-okta-org}.okta.com/oauth2/v1/userinfo

use_pkce = true
...
```

**Troubleshooting**

- "_Okta 400 Bad Request_"
  - Check that you used the correct authorizationUrl & clientId;
  - Check that your application is activated.
- "_Okta 400 Bad Request displayed. Your request resulted in an error. The 'redirect_uri' parameter must be a Login redirect URI in the client app settings_".
  - Make sure you entered https://app.getport.io as a Sign-in redirect URI for your application as mentioned in the steps above.
- "_refused to connect._"
  - Make sure you enabled "IFrame Embedding" as mentioned in the steps above.
- "_Could not fetch your auth token._"
  - Make sure your tokenUrl is the correct url.

### Onelogin

**Steps:**

1. Follow steps 1 & 2 in [Onelogin's documentation](https://onelogin.service-now.com/support?id=kb_article&sys_id=143e6c13dbfd0450ca1c400e0b9619d6#add) to add an OpenId Connect (OIDC) application in your Onelogin organization;
2. Make sure the Port host is in the `Redirect URIs`:
   1. Go to Applications -> The application you just added -> Configuration;
   2. Add `https://app.getport.io` as a Redirect URI.

**Troubleshoot**

- "_unrecognized route or not allowed method_"
  - Check that you used the correct authorizationUrl.
- "_client is invalid_"
  - Check that you used the correct clientId.
- "_redirect_uri did not match any client's registered redirect_uris_".
  - Make sure you entered https://app.getport.io as a Redirect URI for your application as mentioned in the steps above.
- "_Could not fetch your auth token._"
  - Make sure your tokenUrl is the correct URL.
