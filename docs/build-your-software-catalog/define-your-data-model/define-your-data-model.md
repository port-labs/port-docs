Defining your data model for the software catalog is similar to defining a database structure.
You can also use common data models pre-defined by Port.

There are two main building blocks in setting up the data model:

- Blueprints - Represent an **entity type**. Blueprints hold the schema of the entities you wish to represent in the software catalog. For example: a microservice and an environment blueprint.

- Relations - Allows you to define the dependency model between blueprints. Relations turn Port's catalog into a graph-oriented catalog.

## Common data models

- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
  - Common blueprints: Service, Deployment, Environment, Package, Pipeline, Pull Request, etc.
- Cloud
  - Common blueprints: Lambda, EKS, Kafka, S3, Postgres, etc.
- Kubernetes & Argo Catalog
  - Common blueprints: Cluster, CronJob, Namespace, Pods, Replica Sets, Istio, ArgoApp, ArgoProject, etc.
- C4 (Backstage Style)
  - Common blueprints: System, Domain, Resource, Component, Group.
- Multi-cloud architecture
  - Common blueprints: Cloud Vendor, Region, Account, etc.
- Single tenant
  - Common blueprints: Application, Customer, Running Application, etc.

In this [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/dev-portal) example, we can see an example of a comprehensive data model, using Blueprints & Relations. ðŸŽ¬
