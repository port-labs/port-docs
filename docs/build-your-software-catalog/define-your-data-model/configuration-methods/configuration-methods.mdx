# 🔧 Configuration Methods

In order to configure blueprints and begin defining your data model, it is possible to use:

- Port's API;
- Port's Terraform provider;
- Port's web UI.

See the section below to understand how to use the different providers to define your blueprints:

:::tip prerequisites

To use Port's API and Terraform provider, you will need API credentials.

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="current-method" defaultValue="api" values={[
{label: "API", value: "api"},
{label: "Terraform", value: "tf"},
{label: "UI", value: "ui"},
]}>

<TabItem value="api">

Port's API provides a convenient REST interface to perform CRUD operations with blueprints.

Port's API base URL is: `https://api.getport.io/v1`

The base blueprint endpoints support the following HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

- For the `GET`, `POST` and `PUT` methods, use the following endpoint: `https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints`;
- For the `PATCH` and `DELETE` methods, use the following endpoint: `https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints/{blueprint_identifier}`.

For example to create a basic plain blueprint, send an HTTP POST request with following JSON body to `https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints`:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "myIdentifier",
  "title": "My title",
  "description": "My description",
  "icon": "My icon",
  "calculationProperties": {},
  "schema": {
    "properties": {},
    "required": []
  },
  "relations": {}
}
```

To learn more about the JSON structure of a blueprint, refer to the [blueprint structure](../setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md#blueprint-structure) section.

<TabItem value="tf">

Port's [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/port-labs/port-labs/) allows you to configure your blueprints using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

To install the Terraform provider create a `.tf` file specifying the provider:

```hcl showLineNumbers
terraform {
  required_providers {
    port-labs = {
      source  = "port-labs/port-labs"
      version = "~> 0.5.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "port-labs" {
  client_id = "{YOUR CLIENT ID}"     # or set the env var PORT_CLIENT_ID
  secret    = "{YOUR CLIENT SECRET}" # or set the env var PORT_CLIENT_SECRET
}
```

Then run the following command to install the provider in your Terraform workspace:

```shell showLineNumbers
terraform init
```

To create a plain blueprint, create a `.tf` file with the following blueprint resource definition:

```hcl showLineNumbers
resource "port-labs_blueprint" "myBlueprint" {
  title      = "My blueprint"
  icon       = "My icon"
  identifier = "myIdentifier"
  description = "My description"
}
```

Then, by running `terraform plan` and following that, `terraform apply`, a new plain blueprint will be created.

To learn more about the terraform structure of a blueprint, refer to the [blueprint structure](../setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md#blueprint-structure) section and look at the available [properties](../setup-blueprint/properties/properties.md) you can define for your blueprints.

To configure a blueprint using the UI, go to the [DevPortal Setup](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal) page and use the `Add Blueprint` button to begin creating the blueprints that make up your data model.
