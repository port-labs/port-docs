### Limit field

When creating a blueprint property of type {props.property_name} in the UI, use the **limit** field to define how many values users can select for that property.  

In the property creation form, the limit field dropdown provides two options:

- **1 value**: Only one value can be selected.
- **List of values**: Multiple values can be selected.

Selecting the **list of values** option will set the property's `type` to `array` in the JSON definition.

:::info Limit field restriction
The limit field setting, whether it's **1 value** or a **list of values**, is permanent and cannot be changed after the property is created. If you create a property with a single value limit, you wonâ€™t be able to change it later to allow multiple values.  

To change the limit configuration after creation:
1. Create a new property with the **limit** field set to a **list of values**.
2. Use the [migrate blueprint data](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/migrate-data/) feature to insert the data to the new property.
3. Delete the old property.
4. Rename the new property to the old property name (optional).
