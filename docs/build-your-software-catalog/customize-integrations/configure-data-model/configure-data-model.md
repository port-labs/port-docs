# Configure your data model

An integration's data model defines the properties and relationships of the data ingested from the integrated tool. It allows you to specify:

- How your data is represented in Port. 
- The relationships between the integration and other data models in your catalog.
- The properties of the data ingested from the integrated tool and their types.

Your data model is defined using [blueprints](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/), which represent assets in your organization, and [relations](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/relate-blueprints/), which allow you to create logical connections between your blueprints.  
Each blueprint is made up of [properties](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/), which are customizable data fields used to save and display information from your data source.


## How to configure your data model

After installing an integration, you can configure its data model in the [builder page](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal/data-model) of your portal. 

To understand how an integration's data model works, let's take a look at an example.  
After you complete the [onboarding](/quickstart) and connect your Git provider to Port, you will see a `service` blueprint that represents a microservice in your organization (which correlates to a Git repository):

<img src='/img/software-catalog/customize-integrations/serviceBlueprint.png' width='40%' border='1px' />

<br/><br/>

As you can see, this blueprint has several defined properties of different types. All [entities](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/#entities) based on this blueprint will have these properties filled with the ingested data from the Git provider.

Port's [plug & play integrations](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/#available-plug--play-integrations) come with predefined blueprints and their properties, but you can change anything you would like to fit your exact needs:

### Configure properties

You can [create, delete, or edit](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/) any property in any blueprint in your builder.

After changing one or more properties, you may need to adjust the [mapping](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping) of your integration to match the changes made to the data model.

### Relate blueprints

After installing several integrations, you may want to [relate blueprints](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/relate-blueprints/) of different integrations to each other, in order to create logical connections between them.  

For example, say we have a `Github` integration and a `Jira` integration installed. We might want to relate Github's `service` blueprint to Jira's `Issue` blueprint. That way, we can easily see in our catalog which issue belongs to which service.
