# NOTES

- Developer track should not have advanced courses.

- No registration flow is needed.

- A new kind of written content is required for some of the guides - a bit more explanatory, and less guide-like. The focus should be on the "why" as much as the "how".

- Implementation guide - from some feedback we got, it is not being used very often. Regardless, Eric and his colleagues are working on enhancing it.  
  I think we should remove it and incorporate it as material for relevant courses.

- The sidebar will only have an intro page and the 2 tracks.

## Next steps

- Finish mapping out the courses for all tracks and tiers.

- Map out the delta between what we have and what we need to write.

- Prioritize which courses should have videos.

- End of chapter content? Not sure.
