# Integration Name

Port's X integration allows you to model X resources in your software catalog and ingest data into them.

## Overview

This integration allows you to:

- Map and organize your desired X resources and their metadata in Port (see supported resources below).
<!--
If real time is supported, add this to the list:
- Watch for X object changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your software catalog.

If real time is not supported, add this to the list:
- Periodically ingest X resources into Port.

If there are any special capabilities of the integration such as gitops, multi-account support, etc., mention them in the list briefly. For example:
- Manage Port entities using GitOps.
-->

### Supported Resources

The resources that can be ingested from X into Port are listed below.  
It is possible to reference any field that appears in the API responses linked below in the mapping configuration.

- [Resource 1](link-to-api-docs)
- [Resource 2](link-to-api-docs)

<!--
List the resources that can be ingested using this integration, with links to the 3rd party API documentation.
If we support generic resources based on the third party api capabilities link to the docs and how to find it. e.g. like in aws.
-->

## Setup

Choose one of the following installation methods:

<Tabs groupId="installation-methods" queryString="installation-methods">

<TabItem value="hosted-by-port" label="Hosted by Port" default>

<OceanSaasInstallation/>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="real-time-self-hosted" label="Real-time (self-hosted)">

<h2> Prerequisites </h2>
 
<Prerequisites/>

<!-- The INTEGRATION-NAME should be the same as its called in the Data Sources modal in the app -->
<OceanRealtimeInstallation integration="INTEGRATION-NAME" />

This table summarizes the parameters used for the installation.
Note the parameters specific to this integration, they are last in the table.
<!-- Add a table of the available params for installation. The params that are specific for the integration should be last -->

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="one-time-ci" label="Scheduled (CI)">

</TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Configuration

Port integrations use a [YAML mapping block](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping#configuration-structure) to ingest data from the third-party api into Port.

The mapping makes use of the [JQ JSON processor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to select, modify, concatenate, transform and perform other operations on existing fields and values from the integration API.

## Capabilities

<!-- Add any unique capability here using a ### header. For example:
### Ingest files from your repositories
-->

## Limitations

<!-- Add any limitations of the integration here -->

## Examples

<!-- Make sure to add examples of supported blueprints and mappings -->
<!--If there are 5 or more examples, create a new page for the examples and link to it here. -->

To view and test the integration's mapping against examples of the third-party API responses, use the jq playground in your [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources). Find the integration in the list of data sources and click on it to open the playground.

## Alternative installation via webhook

<!-- If the integration has an alternative installation method section, add it here. -->

While the Ocean integration described above is the recommended installation method, you may prefer to use a webhook to ingest data from Jira. If so, use the following instructions:

**Note** that when using the webhook installation method, data will be ingested into Port only when the webhook is triggered.
