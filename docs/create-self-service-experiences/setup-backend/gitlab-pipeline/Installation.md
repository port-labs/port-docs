# Installation

GitLab pipelines can be triggered using [Port's execution agent](/create-self-service-experiences/setup-backend/webhook/port-execution-agent/port-execution-agent.md).

Let's install the agent and configure it to trigger GitLab pipelines.

## Prerequisites

- [Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the chart. Please refer to
  Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) for further details on the installation;
- The connection credentials to Kafka are provided to you by Port;
- If you want to trigger a GitLab Pipeline, you need to have a [GitLab trigger token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/).

:::important Trigger Tokens

In order to trigger your GitLab Pipeline you need to provide a GitLab [trigger token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/triggers/#create-a-trigger-token) as an environment variable.

To provide the trigger token to the agent, pass the helm chart an environment variable with a name that is the combination of the `GitLab group` and `GitLab project` separated by an underscore (`_`) , the name is case sensitive.

For example: `group_project=token`

You can load multiple trigger tokens, for different groups and projects in your GitLab environment.

## Installing the agent

1. Add Port's Helm repo by using the following command:

```bash showLineNumbers
helm repo add port-labs https://port-labs.github.io/helm-charts
```

:::note
If you already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the charts. You can then run `helm search repo port-labs` to see the charts.
:::

2. Install the `port-agent` chart by using the following command:

```bash showLineNumbers
helm install my-port-agent port-labs/port-agent \
    --create-namespace --namespace port-agent \
    --set env.normal.PORT_ORG_ID=YOUR_ORG_ID \
    --set env.normal.KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP_ID=YOUR_KAFKA_CONSUMER_GROUP \
    --set env.secret.PORT_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_PORT_CLIENT_ID \
    --set env.secret.PORT_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_PORT_CLIENT_SECRET \
    --set env.secret.<YOUR GITLAB GROUP>_<YOUR GITLAB PROJECT>=YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN
```

### Self Hosted GitLab

If you are using a private GitLab environment, pass the `GITLAB_URL` environment variable to your Port agent installation:

```bash showLineNumbers
--set env.normal.GITLAB_URL
```

Done! **Port's execution agent** is now running in your environment and will trigger any GitLab pipeline that you have configured.

## Control the payload

The Port agent allows you to control the payload that is sent to gitlab api when triggering a pipeline.

By customizing the payload you can control the data that is sent to gitlab and the way the pipeline is triggered.

By default, the Port agent use the this default mapping to trigger gitlab pipelines:

<details>
<summary>Default Gitlab port agent mapping</summary>

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "enabled": ".payload.action.invocationMethod.type == \"GITLAB\"",
    "url": "(env.GITLAB_URL // \"https://gitlab.com/\") as $baseUrl | (.payload.action.invocationMethod.groupName + \"/\" +.payload.action.invocationMethod.projectName) | @uri as $path | $baseUrl + \"api/v4/projects/\" + $path + \"/trigger/pipeline\"",
    "body": {
      "ref": ".payload.properties.ref // .payload.action.invocationMethod.defaultRef // \"main\"",
      "token": ".payload.action.invocationMethod.groupName as $gitlab_group | .payload.action.invocationMethod.projectName as $gitlab_project | env[($gitlab_group | gsub(\"/\"; \"_\")) + \"_\" + $gitlab_project]",
      "variables": ".payload.action.invocationMethod as $invocationMethod | .payload.properties | to_entries | map({(.key): (.value | tostring)}) | add | if $invocationMethod.omitUserInputs then {} else . end",
      "port_payload": "if .payload.action.invocationMethod.omitPayload then {} else . end"
    }
  }
]
```

</details>
