# Change status of Jira ticket

## Overview
This self-service guide facilitates transitioning the status of a Jira ticket from Port using Port's self service actions. With this, you can manage ticket (issue) status without leaving Port.

## Prerequisites
1. [Port's GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/getport-io) needs to be installed.
2. In your GitHub repository, [go to **Settings > Secrets**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) and add the following secrets:
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN` - [Jira API token](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account) generated by the user.
   - `JIRA_BASE_URL` - The URL of your Jira organization. For example, https://your-organization.atlassian.net.
   - `JIRA_USER_EMAIL` - The email of the Jira user that owns the Jira API token.
   - `PORT_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` - Your port `client id` [How to get the credentials](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/api/#find-your-port-credentials).
   - `PORT_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - Your port `client secret` [How to get the credentials](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/api/#find-your-port-credentials).
3. Optional - Install Port's Jira integration [learn more](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/jira/)

	:::tip Jira Integration
	This step is not required for this example, but it will create all the blueprint boilerplate for you, and also ingest and update the catalog in real time with your Jira Issues.
	:::

4. In Case you decided not to install the Jira integration, you will need to create a blueprint for the Jira issue in Port.

## GitHub Workflow

Create the file `.github/workflows/change-jira-ticket-status.yml` in the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository.

:::tip
We recommend creating a dedicated repository for the workflows that are used by Port actions.

6. Click `Save`.

Now you should see the `Change Jira ticket status` action in the self-service page. üéâ

## Let's test it!

1. Head to the [Self Service hub](https://app.getport.io/self-serve)
2. Click on the `Change Jira ticket status` action
3. Choose the jira ticket you want to change the status for (In case you didn't install the [Jira integration](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/jira/), it means you don't have any Jira tickets in Port yet, so you will need to create one manually in Port to test this action)
4. Select the new status
5. Click on `Execute`
6. Done! wait for the ticket's status to be changed in Jira

Congrats üéâ You've changed a ticket status in Port üî•
