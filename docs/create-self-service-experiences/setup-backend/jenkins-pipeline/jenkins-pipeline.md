# Triggering Jenkins using webhooks

In this guide, you will learn how to trigger your [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) Pipelines from Port, using [Webhook Actions](../webhook/).

![Illustration](../../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setup-backend/jenkins-pipeline/jenkins-illustration.png)

The steps shown in the image above are as follows:

1. An action is invoked in Port;
2. Port signs the action payload using SHA-1 with the [`clientSecret`](../../../build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/api/api.md#find-your-port-credentials) value and puts it in the `X-Port-Signature` request header.

   :::info WEBHOOK SECURITY
   Verifying the webhook request using the request headers provides the following benefits:

   - Ensures that the request payload has not been tampered with
   - Ensures that the sender of the message is Port
   - Ensures that the received message is not a replay of an older message

   :::

3. Port publishes an invoked `WEBHOOK` via a `POST` request to `https://{JENKINS_URL}/generic-webhook-trigger/invoke`

An example flow would be:

1. A developer asks to run a Jenkins pipeline;
2. Port sends a `POST` request with the action payload to the Jenkins webhook `URL`;
3. The Jenkins webhook receives the new action request;
4. The Jenkins webhook triggers the pipeline;

## Prerequisites

Jenkins required plugins:

- [Generic webhook trigger](https://plugins.jenkins.io/generic-webhook-trigger/) - Allows triggering Jenkins pipelines using webhook calls.

## Setting up the webhook

### Enabling webhook trigger for a pipeline

To enable triggering a Jenkins pipeline using a webhook invocation, you will need to add "Generic Webhook Trigger" as a build trigger to your pipeline.

In your job's page, enter the **Configuration** tab, and scroll down to the **Build Triggers** section. Check the `Generic Webhook Trigger` box:

![Enable generic webhook](../../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setup-backend/jenkins-pipeline/check-generic-webhook-option.png)

By default, when enabling the webhook trigger for a job, it can be triggered by sending an event to `http://JENKINS_URL/generic-webhook-trigger/invoke`. This means that, if not configured otherwise, all jobs will be triggered when sending an event to this route. It is recommended to set up a [job token](jenkins-pipeline.md#token-setup) to avoid running unwanted jobs.

### Defining variables

After checking the box, look for the **Post content parameters** section. This is where you will define the variables which will be passed to your pipeline run.

- The `Variable` field value should match the name of the variable that is defined in your job configuration and expected by the job run.
- The `Expression` field should be set to `JSONPath` and be directed to the relevant property sent by the Port action.

:::tip
Here is part of the JSON scheme of the Port action, which shows the inputs sent by Port when triggering the action:

```json showLineNumber
[
  {
    "identifier": "runPipeline",
    "title": "Run Pipeline",
    "icon": "Jenkins",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "input1": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
    ... # Port Action configuration
]
```

Here is a sample payload that is generated when the action is triggered and sent to Jenkins:

```json showLineNumber
{
    ... # Event metadata
    "payload": {
        "properties": {
            "input1": "input1_value"
        }

    }

}
```

For example, the JSONPath for `input1` would be:

```text
$.payload.properties.input1
```

**Port Action** - The full Port action definition can be found [here](./jenkins-pipeline.md#setting-up-the-port-action).

:::

### Token setup

The [token parameter](https://plugins.jenkins.io/generic-webhook-trigger/#plugin-content-token-parameter) allows triggering a specific (or a group) of jobs.

To set up a token for you job, scroll down to the **Token** section, and provide a job token:

![Configure Token](../../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setup-backend/jenkins-pipeline/configure-token.png)

After saving, you will be able to specifically trigger this job job, using the following URL:

```text showLineNumbers
http://JENKINS_URL/generic-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=<JOB_TOKEN>
```

### Setting up the Port action

To trigger the Jenkins pipeline, you will setup a Port [Webhook Action](../webhook/).

Here is an example for an action that will trigger the webhook you just set up:

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "identifier": "runPipeline",
    "title": "Run Pipeline",
    "icon": "Jenkins",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "input1": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    },
    # highlight-start
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "http://JENKINS_URL/generic-webhook-trigger/invoke?token=<JOB_TOKEN>"
    },
    # highlight-end
    "trigger": "CREATE",
    "description": "Run Jenkins pipeline"
  }
]
```

### Securing your webhook

It is possible to add a protection layer to your exposed pipelines by [configuring whitelisting](https://plugins.jenkins.io/generic-webhook-trigger/#plugin-content-whitelist-hosts).

Whitelisting gives you the following security options:

- Limit the list of IP addresses that can send a request that triggers the pipeline;
- Add [validation](../webhook/signature-verification.md) for the webhook payload content to verify that it really originated from Port.

Here is an example of the required configuration:

![Webhook Validation](../../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setup-backend/jenkins-pipeline/validate-webhook.png)

:::note

- The IP field should be set to `3.251.12.205`, which is our hosted outbound WEBHOOK Gateway.
- In the **HMAC Secret** field, choose a secret containing your `port-client-secret`.

If this secret doesn't already exist, create a `secret text` type secret using [this guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/using/using-credentials/). The value of the secret should be your `Port Client Secret` which can be found by following the guide [here](https://docs.getport.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/api/#find-your-port-credentials).
