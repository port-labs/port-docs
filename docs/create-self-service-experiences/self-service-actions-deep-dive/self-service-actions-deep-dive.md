# Self-Service Actions Deep Dive

**Self-Service Actions** in Port enable developer self-service by configuring one of the 3 Self-Service Action types on Blueprints and the Entities that originated from them:

- **Create** - a new Entity by triggering a provisioning process in your infrastructure.
- **Delete** - an existing Entity by triggering delete logic in your infrastructure.
- **Day-2 Operations** - trigger an existing Entity’s logic in your infrastructure to update or modify the existing Entity on demand.

:::info
This deep dive's purpose is to teach you how to configure Self-Service Actions, understand their structure and the different options they offer you.

To learn how to update the status of an existing Self-Service Action invocation, refer to the [reflect action progress](../reflect-action-progress/reflect-action-progress.md) page
:::

## Configuring a new self-service action

Let's configure new Self-Service Actions, starting with the Blueprints.

### Creating blueprints

For example, let’s create 2 Blueprints and connect them to each other:

- **Blueprint #1**: Microservice;
- **Blueprint #2**: Deployment.

      }
    },
    "required": []
  }
}
```

  "identifier": "deployment",
  "title": "Deployment",

}
```

### Creating the blueprint self-service action

In order to create a Self-Service Action, go to the DevPortal Builder page, expand the Microservice Blueprint and click on the `Create action` button as shown below:

![Create action button on blueprint marked](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/createActionOnBlueprintButtonMarked.png)

After clicking the button, you should see an editor with an empty array (`[]`) appear, that's where we will add our Self-Service Action

Here is an action array with a `CREATE` action already filled in:

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "identifier": "create",
    "title": "Create",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "repo-user": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo User",
          "default": "port-labs"
        },
        "repo-name": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo Name",
          "default": "*My-microservice*"
        }
      },
      "required": ["repo-user"]
    },
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "trigger": "CREATE",
    "description": "This will create a new microservice repo"
  }
]
```

This is how the JSON editor looks after submitting the Self-Service Action:

![Action editor filled](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/microserviceEditorWithCreateAction.png)

Now when you go to the Microservices Blueprint page, you will see a new button - `Create Microservice`:

![Create button marked](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/microservicePageWithCreateMarked.png)

After clicking the `Create Microservice` option, we will see a form with the inputs specified when the new action was entered to the actions array:

![Action create form](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/actionCreateForm.png)

### More Self-Service Actions

Let's go back to the actions array of our `Microservice` Blueprint and paste in the following JSON, which has 2 additional configured actions:

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "identifier": "create",
    "title": "Create",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "repo-user": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo User",
          "default": "port-labs"
        },
        "repo-name": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo Name",
          "default": "*My-microservice*"
        }
      },
      "required": ["repo-user"]
    },
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "trigger": "CREATE",
    "description": "This will create a new microservice repo"
  },
  {
    "identifier": "deploy",
    "title": "Deploy",
    "icon": "Deployment",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "environment": {
          "type": "string",
          "enum": ["Prod", "Test", "Staging"],
          "title": "Environment"
        },
        "branch": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Branch Name"
        },
        "commit-hash": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Commit Hash"
        }
      },
      "required": ["environment", "branch", "commit-hash"]
    },
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "trigger": "DAY-2",
    "description": "This will deploy the microservice"
  },
  {
    "identifier": "delete",
    "title": "Delete",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {},
      "required": []
    },
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "trigger": "DELETE",
    "description": "This will delete the microservice's repo"
  }
]
```

Now when we go back to the Microservice page, if we click on the 3 dots next to an existing entity, we should see the Day-2 and delete Self-Service Actions we just added:

**Day-2:**

![Day-2 button marked](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/day-2-action-marked.png)

**Delete:**

![Delete button marked](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/delete-action-marked.png)

#### Add multiple Self-Service Actions of the same type

You can add multiple Self-Service Actions of the same type (e.g. `Create` or `Delete`).

For instance, you can add 2 `Create` Self-Service Actions to the `Microservice` Blueprint, to support different programming languages:

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "identifier": "create_python",
    "title": "Create Python",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "repo-user": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo User",
          "default": "port-labs"
        },
        "repo-name": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo Name",
          "default": "*My-Python-microservice*"
        }
      },
      "required": ["repo-user"]
    },
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "trigger": "CREATE",
    "description": "This will create a new Python microservice repo"
  },
  {
    "identifier": "create_go",
    "title": "Create Go",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "repo-user": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo User",
          "default": "port-labs"
        },
        "repo-name": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo Name",
          "default": "*My-Go-microservice*"
        }
      },
      "required": ["repo-user"]
    },
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "trigger": "CREATE",
    "description": "This will create a new Go microservice repo"
  }
]
```

Now when you go to the Microservices Blueprint page, you will see 2 new buttons - `Create Python Microservice` and `Create Go Microservice`:

<center>

![Multiple Create Actions](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/multiple-create-actions.png)

</center>

## Manual approval

You can configure a manual approval step for your actions. This is useful when an action might be dangerous/destructive/expensive or organizational policy determines that it requires an extra pair of eyes before going through.

To configure a manual approval step, add the `requiredApproval` field to your action:

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {
    "identifier": "create",
    "title": "Create",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "repo-user": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo User",
          "default": "port-labs"
        },
        "repo-name": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Repo Name",
          "default": "*My-microservice*"
        }
      },
      "required": ["repo-user"]
    },
    "invocationMethod": {
      "type": "WEBHOOK",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "trigger": "CREATE",
    "requiredApproval": true,
    "description": "This will create a new microservice repo"
  }
]
```

When a user clicks on the `execute` button of an action that requires approval, a new `run` object will be created in Port. The `run` object will have the status `WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL` and will be visible in the `Runs` tab of the action.

To configure which users can approve the action, see [Managing permissions](../../build-your-software-catalog/set-catalog-rbac/examples.md#setting-action-permissions).

## Self-Service Action definition structure

### Special formats

In addition to the formats that were introduced in [Blueprint string property formats](../../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/properties.md#supported-properties), Port's Self-Service Actions also support the following special formats:

| `type`       | Description                                  | Example values                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `entity`     | Entity from a specified Blueprint            | `"notifications-service"`                       |
| Entity array | Array of Entities from a specified Blueprint | `["notifications-service", "frontend-service"]` |

#### Examples

Here is how to use property formats:

#### Entity

```json showLineNumbers
"entity_prop": {
    "title": "My string prop",
    // highlight-start
    "type": "string",
    "format": "entity",
    "blueprint": "microservice",
    // highlight-end
    "description": "This is an entity property"
}
```

When `"format": "entity"` is used, a `blueprint` field is available.

The `blueprint` field takes an identifier of an existing Blueprint. Then, when using the configured Self-Service Action in Port's UI, the specified field will include a list of existing Entities of the selected Blueprint from your software catalog to choose from.

#### Entity Array

```json showLineNumbers
"entity_prop": {
    "title": "My string prop",
    "description": "This property is an array of Entities",
    // highlight-start
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
      "type": "string",
      "blueprint": "service",
      "format": "entity"
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

When `"type": "array"` is used, you can create an `items` property. Within `items` you can use `"format": "entity"` and write the identifier of the selected `blueprint` which you want to include Entities from (similar to [Entity](#entity) format). You can then pass an Entity array to your Port Action.

## Invocation method

The `invocationMethod` object controls where Self-Service Actions are reported to.

The `invocationMethod` supports 3 configurations:

- [Webhook](../setup-backend/webhook/webhook.md)
- [Kafka](../setup-backend/kafka/kafka.md)
- [GitHub](../setup-backend/github-workflow/github-workflow.md)
- [GitLab](../setup-backend/gitlab-pipeline/gitlab-pipeline.md)

### Invocation method structure fields

## Triggering actions

We will now look at trigger examples for each action type and explain what happens behind the scenes when we execute each type.

When we click on the `execute` button of an action, a Port [action message](#action-message-structure) is published to the invocation destination specified by the user.

For example, you can deploy a new version of your microservice when a `CREATE` action is triggered.

### CREATE action

The action is triggered from the page matching the Blueprint we configured the action on:

![Create button marked](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/microservicePageWithCreateMarked.png)

:::tip create vs register
When you define a `CREATE` action on a Blueprint, when viewing the Blueprint page you will notice that the create button now has a dropdown. Two options will appear: `Register` and `Create`:

- `Register` - this option is used to add a new Entity to your catalog without triggering a `CREATE` action. This option is useful for cases when an infrastructure Entity was created before using Port, and you want to import its data into the Software Catalog.

  This option is also useful for cases where an entity was created manually and you want to document it in Port after-the-fact.

- `Create` - this option will display the form containing the required `userInputs` of our actions. After clicking execute, a new execution message will be sent to Port's Kafka Topics so you can handle the create request in your infrastructure.

:::

When clicking the `Create Microservice` option, we will see a form with the inputs we specified when we entered the new action to the actions array:

![Action create form](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/actionCreateForm.png)

### DAY-2 action

The action can be triggered by selecting it from the sub-menu of an existing Entity:

![Day-2 button marked](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/day-2-action-marked.png)

:::note DAY-2 actions
All Day-2 operations will appear in this sub-menu.
:::

### DELETE action

The action can be triggered by selecting it from the sub-menu of an existing Entity:

![Delete button marked](../../../static/img/self-service-actions/setting-self-service-actions-in-port/delete-action-marked.png)

## Action message structure

Every invocation of a Self-Service Action publishes a new `run` message (with its own unique `runId` value). Let’s explore the structure of a Self-Service Action run message:

| Field          | Description                                                                                  | Example               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `action`       | Action identifier                                                                            | `Create microservice` |
| `resourceType` | Resource type that triggered the action. In case of action runs, it always defaults to `run` | `run`                 |
| `status`       | Action status. In the case of action runs, it always defaults to `TRIGGERED`                 | `TRIGGERED`           |
| `trigger`      | Audit data for the action run                                                                | Example below         |
| `context`      | Contains the context of the action, and has keys for `blueprint`, `entity` and `runId`       | Example below         |
| `payload`      | Explanation below                                                                            | Example below         |

### Example Trigger

The trigger includes audit data such as who triggered the action, and when and how did they trigger it (`UI` or `API`)

```json showLineNumbers
"trigger": {
    "by": {
        "userId": "auth0|<USER>",
        "orgId": "<ORG>",
        "user": {
          "email": "<USER_EMAIL>",
          "firstName": "<USER_FIRST_NAME>",
          "lastName": "<USER_LASTT_NAME",
          "id": "<USER_ID>"
        }
    },
    "at": "2022-07-27T17:50:58.776Z",
    "origin": "UI"
}
```

### Example context

```json showLineNumbers
"context": {
    "entity": null,
    "blueprint": "k8sCluster",
    "runId": "r_AtbOjbe45GNDElcQ"
}
```

### Self-Service Action run payload

The `payload` object contains the data of the Self-Service Action invocation, it includes the following keys:

- `entity` - The Entity the run is executed on (in the case of `DAY-2` or `DELETE`, for `CREATE` it will be null).
- `action` - Definition of the action that was triggered, includes all of the action configuration, including expected `userInputs`, `description`, etc.
- `properties` - This key includes the values provided by the developer when executing the action. The keys in this object match the keys defined under the `userInputs` key in the action definition.

Here is an example `payload` object for a `CREATE` action:

```json showLineNumbers
"payload": {
    "entity": null,
    "action": {
        "id": "action_lGviYLG6W5U9o2Qq",
        "identifier": "create",
        "title": "Create",
        "userInputs": {
            "properties": {
                "title": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Title"
                },
                "region": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Region",

                    "description": "The region that this cluster is going to be deployed"
                },
                "version": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "title": "Version"
                },
                "type": {

                    ]
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "region"
            ]
        },
        "invocationMethod": { "type": "WEBHOOK", "url": "https://example.com" },
