# ðŸ”§ Configuration Methods

Port supports a variety of data ingestions methods and integrations, the core data ingestions methods are:

- Port's API;
- Port's Terraform provider;
- Port's web UI.

See the section below to understand how to use the different methods to define your blueprints and relations:

:::tip prerequisites

To use Port's API and Terraform provider, you will need API credentials.

<Tabs groupId="config" queryString="current-method" defaultValue="api" values={[
{label: "API", value: "api"},
{label: "Terraform", value: "tf"},
{label: "UI", value: "ui"},
]}>

<TabItem value="api">

Port's [API](../api-reference/api-reference.mdx) provides a convenient REST interface to perform CRUD operations with blueprints.

Port's API base URL is: `https://api.getport.io/v1`

The API supports all common HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`

All API endpoints follow a resource based access schema, for exmaple:

- Blueprint based routes start with `https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints`;
- Entity based routes start with `https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints/{blueprint_identifier}/entities` (because they are a resource tied to blueprints);
- Self-service action based routes start with `https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints/{blueprint_identifier}/actions`;
- etc.

To learn more about the JSON structure of different API objects, refer to their respective category and structure reference, for example - [blueprint structure](../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md#blueprint-structure).

<TabItem value="tf">

Port's [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/port-labs/port-labs/) allows you to configure your blueprints using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

To install the Terraform provider create a `.tf` file specifying the provider:

```hcl showLineNumbers
terraform {
  required_providers {
    port-labs = {
      source  = "port-labs/port-labs"
      version = "~> 0.5.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "port-labs" {
  client_id = "{YOUR CLIENT ID}"     # or set the env var PORT_CLIENT_ID
  secret    = "{YOUR CLIENT SECRET}" # or set the env var PORT_CLIENT_SECRET
}
```

Then run the following command to install the provider in your Terraform workspace:

```shell showLineNumbers
terraform init
```

To create a plain blueprint, create a `.tf` file with the following blueprint resource definition:

```hcl showLineNumbers
resource "port-labs_blueprint" "myBlueprint" {
  title      = "My blueprint"
  icon       = "My icon"
  identifier = "myIdentifier"
  description = "My description"
}
```

Then, by running `terraform plan` and following that, `terraform apply`, a new plain blueprint will be created.

To learn more about the terraform structure of a blueprint, refer to the [blueprint structure](../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/setup-blueprint.md#blueprint-structure) section and look at the available [properties](../build-your-software-catalog/define-your-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/properties.md) you can define for your blueprints.

To configure a blueprint using the UI, go to the [DevPortal Setup](https://app.getport.io/dev-portal) page and use the `Add Blueprint` button to begin creating the blueprints that make up your data model.
