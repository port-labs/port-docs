:::tip Available Github Integrations
This guide includes one or more steps that require integration with GitHub.  
Port supports two GitHub integrations:
- **GitHub (Legacy)** - uses a GitHub app, which is soon to be deprecated.
- **GitHub (Ocean)** - uses the [Ocean framework](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github-ocean/installation), recommended for new integrations.

Both integration options are present in this guide via tabs, choose the one that fits your needs.
