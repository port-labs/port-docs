# Ingest cloud resources with Datadog

This guide aims to show you how to ingest cloud resources using Datadog to have a good grasp of the cloud resources/entities you have from your cloud provider.


## Common use cases
- Map your monitored resources from cloud providers in Datadog

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes the following:
- You have a Port account and that you have finished the [onboarding process](/quickstart).
- You have [installed and setup Port's Datadog integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/apm-alerting/datadog/datadog.md)
- You have installed integrations for [GCP](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/google_cloud_platform/?tab=project), [AWS](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/#cat-aws) and [Azure](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/azure/) on your Datadog environment


## Ingesting cloud resources into Port
We will be making use of the `hosts` kind in Port's Datadog integration which provides information on hosts existing on the cloud providers we have configured. For this example, we are only interested in hosts with `gcp`, `aws`, and `azure` in the `sources` property.

1. Having installed the Datadog integration, create the `datadogCloudResource` blueprint in your Port environment using the blueprint below:

<details>
<summary><b>Datadog Cloud Resource Blueprint (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "datadogCloudResource",
  "description": "This blueprint represents a cloud resource in Datadog",
  "title": "Datadog Cloud Resource",
  "icon": "Datadog",
  "schema": {
    "properties": {
      "up": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "title": "Is Running?",
        "description": "Is the host up?"
      },
      "host_name": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Host Name",
        "description": "the name of the host"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Description",
        "description": "the host description"
      },
      "platform": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Platform",
        "description": "the host platform"
      },
      "machine": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Machine",
        "description": "The CPU architecture of the host machine (e.g., amd64, x86, x64, arm, arm64)."
      },
      "cpu_cores": {
        "type": "number",
        "title": "CPU Cores",
        "description": "the host CPU cores"
      },
      "agent_version": {
        "type": "string",
        "title": "Datadog Agent Version",
        "description": "the Datadog agent version installed on the host"
      },
      "is_muted": {
        "type": "boolean",
        "title": "Is Host Muted?",
        "description": "Indicates whether alerts for that specific host are temporarily suppressed."
      },
      "sources": {
        "title": "Sources",
        "type": "array",
        "description": "Source or cloud provider associated with your host."
      },
      "tags": {
        "title": "Tags",
        "type": "object",
        "description": "Tags associated with the host."
      }
    },
    "required": []
  },
  "mirrorProperties": {},
  "calculationProperties": {},
  "relations": {}
}
```

</details>

2. Head over to the [Data Sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) in your Port environment and select the Datadog integration

3. Create a new mapping config with the following

<details>
<summary><b>Datadog Cloud Resource mapping config (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers

deleteDependentEntities: true
createMissingRelatedEntities: true
resources:
  - kind: host
    selector:
      query: >-
        [.sources[] | . as $source | ["azure", "gcp", "gce", "aws"] |
        contains([$source])] | any(.)
    port:
      entity:
        mappings:
          blueprint: '"datadogCloudResource"'
          identifier: .id | tostring
          title: .aws_name // .host_name
          properties:
            up: .up
            host_name: .host_name
            platform: .meta.platform
            is_muted: .is_muted
            machine: .meta.machine
            description: .description
            sources: .sources
            cpu_cores: .meta.cpuCores
            agent_version: .meta.agent_version
            tags: .tags_by_source


```

</details>

:::info Mapping explanation
Cloud resources from Datadog are hosts from the `host` kind of the Datadog integration which are from GCP, AWS or Azure. To ingest them, we have to specify a selector which allows only such hosts with the sources we specify.

By doing this, we are able to ingest all cloud resources from Datadog

4. Finally, click `resync`. Your cloud resources from Datadog should now be ingested:
