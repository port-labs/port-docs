# Enrich tasks with AI-powered context

## Overview

This guide will walk you through setting up a "Task Assistant" AI agent in Port.  
By the end of this guide, your developers will receive automated, contextual insights when they start working on tasks, including related issues, pull requests, and potential collaborators.

## Common use cases

- Automatically provide context when developers start working on tasks.
- Identify related issues and pull requests.
- Suggest potential collaborators based on task context.
- Enable easy commenting on Jira issues through Port.


## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have:
- A Port account with the [AI agents feature enabled](/ai-interfaces/ai-agents/overview#access-to-the-feature).
- Appropriate permissions to create and configure AI agents.
- [Jira integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/project-management/jira/) configured in your Port instance.
- [GitHub integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/) configured in your Port instance.

## Set up data model

To create an Task Assistant AI agent in Port, we'll need to configure the following components as described in our [Build an AI agent](/ai-interfaces/ai-agents/build-an-ai-agent) guide:
-  The data sources it will use to answer questions about tasks and their related issues and collaborators.
-  The agent configuration that defines its capabilities and conversation starters.
-  An automation to analyze the task and trigger the agent.
-  A self-service action to comment on the Jira issue.

### Configure data source access

For this guide, we will be using **Jira** as our primary data source to provide comprehensive task management capabilities. 
This integration will automatically create and configure all the necessary resources needed by the Task Assistant AI agent.

Install the following integration to have access to these data sources:
- [Port's Jira integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/project-management/jira/) for projects, tasks and issues.

    :::info Optional tools
    While this guide uses Jira, you can choose tools that best fit your organization's needs. 
    For example, GitHub or ServiceNow.

### Create the agent configuration

1. Go to the [AI Agents](https://app.getport.io/_ai_agents) page.
2. Click on `+ AI Agent`.
3. Toggle `Json mode` on.
4. Copy and paste the following JSON schema:

   <details>
   <summary><b>Task Assistant AI agent configuration (Click to expand)</b></summary>

   ```json showLineNumbers
   {
     "identifier": "task_assistant_ai_agent",
     "title": "Task Assistant AI Agent",
     "icon": "Airflow",
     "properties": {
       "status": "active",
       "allowed_blueprints": [
         "service",
         "githubRepository",
         "_user",
         "githubPullRequest",
         "jiraIssue",
         "jiraProject",
         "githubUser",
         "_team",
         "jiraUser"
       ],
       "allowed_actions": [
         "comment_on_jira_issue"
       ],
       "executionMode": "Automatic",
       "prompt": "## Comment Format\n\nHey there [User's First Name], it's Clarity - the Port AI agent!\nI noticed you just started working on a new task: [link to assigned issue].\nHere's some context to help you get started\n\nDevs who might have input:\nList up to 3 developers (excluding the user), explain briefly why each is relevant. If none, write a meaningful explanation.\n\nSimilar Jira Issues:\nList up to 3 Jira issues (not assigned to the user), mention the assigned person and why it's relevant. If none, explain why.\n\nSimilar Pull Requests:\nList up to 3 pull requests (not assigned to the user), mention the creator and why it's relevant. If none, explain why.\n\nEach section can have fewer than 3 items. Always explain if empty.\n\n## Instructions\n\nSend the comment according to the format above in the most relevant given JIRA Issue. Use the `comment_on_jira_issue` tool to achieve that.",
       "allowed_tools": [
         "Entities Search",
         "Entities Similarity Search",
         "Entities Group"
       ]
     },
     "relations": {}
   }
   ```
   </details>

5. Click on `Create` to save the agent.

### Set up the automation trigger

Now that we have created the Task Assistant AI agent, we need to set up an automation that will be triggered automatically whenever a task is assigned or the status is changed to "In Progress".

Follow the steps below to set up the automation:

1. Go to the [Automations](https://app.getport.io/automations) page.
2. Click on `+ Automation`.
3. Copy and paste the following JSON schema:

   <details>
   <summary><b>Send context to task assignee automation (Click to expand)</b></summary>

   ```json showLineNumbers
   {
     "identifier": "send_context_to_task_assignee",
     "title": "Send context to task assignee",
     "description": "Triggers on Jira task status change to In Progress or assignee",
     "trigger": {
       "type": "automation",
       "event": {
         "type": "ENTITY_UPDATED",
         "blueprintIdentifier": "jiraIssue"
       },
       "condition": {
         "type": "JQ",
         "expressions": [
           ".diff.after.relations.assignee != null",
           ".diff.after.properties.status == \"In Progress\"",
           ".diff.before.properties.status == \"To Do\" or .diff.before.relations.assignee != .diff.after.relations.assignee"
         ],
         "combinator": "and"
       }
     },
     "invocationMethod": {
       "type": "WEBHOOK",
       "url": "https://api.getport.io/v1/agent/task_assistant_ai_agent/invoke",
       "synchronized": true,
       "body": {
         "prompt": "User's email: \"{{.event.diff.after.relations.assignee}}\" . Task title: \"{{.event.diff.after.title}}\". Task identifier: \"{{.event.diff.after.identifier}}\".",
         "labels": {
           "source": "Automation"
         }
       }
     },
     "publish": true
   }
   ```
   </details>

4. Click on `Create` to save the automation.

### Configure the self-service action

:::info Jira Cloud ID
The value `{{cloudId}}` in the URL is your Jira Cloud ID. If you've recently installed Jira and have a "create a Jira issue" action, you can copy it from there. Otherwise, you can find your Jira Cloud ID by following [this guide](https://support.atlassian.com/jira/kb/retrieve-my-atlassian-sites-cloud-id/).
:::

We need to configure a self-service action which can be triggered by the agent or manually by the user to comment on issues directly from Port.

1. Go to the [Self Service Actions](https://app.getport.io/self-service) page.
2. Click on `+ Action`.
3. Copy and paste the following JSON schema:

   <details>
   <summary><b>Comment on Jira issue action (Click to expand)</b></summary>

   ```json showLineNumbers
   {
     "identifier": "comment_on_jira_issue",
     "title": "Comment on a Jira issue",
     "icon": "Jira",
     "description": "Comments on an existing Jira issue",

                   "property": "jira_user_id",
                   "operator": "isNotEmpty"
                 }
               ]
             }
           },
           "comment": {
             "title": "Comment",
             "icon": "DefaultProperty",
             "type": "string",
             "format": "markdown"
           }
         },
         "required": [],
         "order": [
           "comment",
           "assignee"
         ]

       },
       "body": {

                 }
               ],

             }
           ],
           "type": "doc",
           "version": 1
         },
         "visibility": {
           "identifier": "Administrators",
           "type": "role",
           "value": "Administrators"
         }
       }
     },
     "requiredApproval": false
   }
   ```

## Best practices

To get the most out of your Task Assistant agent:

1. **Monitor responses**: Review the agent's messages to ensure they provide valuable context.

3. **Refine the prompt**: Adjust the agent's prompt based on your team's needs and feedback.

3. **Test thoroughly**: Create test issues to verify both automated messages and manual comments work as expected.

## Possible enhancements

You can further enhance the Task Assistant setup by:

- **Integration expansion**: Add more data sources like Confluence or ServiceNow for broader context.

- **Custom triggers**: Configure additional automation triggers based on other task events.
