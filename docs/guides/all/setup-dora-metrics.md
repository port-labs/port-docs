# Track DORA metrics

This guide is designed
to help you
implement and track [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance) within your organization in Port.  

DORA Metrics are a set of key performance indicators
that measure the effectiveness and efficiency of your software development and delivery process. 
By tracking these metrics,
you can identify areas for improvement and ensure that your team is delivering high-quality software efficiently.
This guide will cover the four key metrics: **deployment frequency**, **lead time**, **change failure rate**, and **mean time to recovery**.

### Prerequisites
- Complete the [Port onboarding process](https://docs.getport.io/quickstart).
- Access to a repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Azure Repos) that is connected to Port via the onboarding process.
- While this guide demonstrates implementations using **GitHub**, **GitLab**, and **Azure Repos**, other Git providers can be used as well.
- Optional for advanced strategies: If you're using workflows or pipelines, ensure they are configured for deployment tracking by following the relevant setup guides, such as CI/CD integrations or your platform-specific tools.


## Tracking deployments

In this section, we will cover how to track your team's deployments. Deployments refer to releasing new or updated code into various environments, such as **Production**, **Staging**, or **Testing**. Tracking deployments helps you understand how efficiently your team ships features and monitors release stability.

Deployments contribute to three key DORA metrics:

- **Deployment Frequency**: How often changes are deployed to production or other environments.
- **Change Failure Rate**: The percentage of deployments that fail and require intervention, rollback, or generate issues.
- **Lead Time for Changes**: The time it takes from code commit to deployment into production.

To track the necessary data for these metrics, we will create a **Deployment Blueprint** with properties that capture the essential information for each deployment.

### Data model setup

1. Navigate to your [Port Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page.
2. Click the `+ Blueprint` button to create a new blueprint.
3. Name it `Deployment` and add the schema below:

<details>
<summary><b>Deployment blueprint (click to expand)</b></summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "deployment",
  "title": "Deployment",
  "icon": "Rocket",
  "schema": {
    "properties": {
      "createdAt": {
        "title": "Deployment Time",
        "type": "string",
        "format": "date-time",
        "description": "The timestamp when the deployment was triggered."
      },
      "environment": {
        "title": "Environment",
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "Production",
          "Staging",
          "Testing"
        ],
        "description": "The environment where the deployment occurred."
      },
      "deploymentStatus": {
        "title": "Deployment Status",
        "type": "string",
        "enum": [
          "Success",
          "Failed"
        ],
        "description": "Indicates whether the deployment was successful or failed."
      }
    },
    "required": []
  },
  "mirrorProperties": {
    "leadTimeHours": {
      "title": "Lead Time (Hours)",
      "path": "pullRequest.leadTimeHours"
    }
  },
  "calculationProperties": {},
  "aggregationProperties": {},
  "relations": {
    "service": {
      "title": "Service",
      "target": "service",
      "required": false,
      "many": false
    },
    "pullRequest": {
      "title": "Pull Request",
      "target": "githubPullRequest",
      "required": false,
      "many": false
    }
  }
}
```
</details>

:::note Missing Lead Time
If you do not have the **lead time** configured, you can follow the integration guide for your Git provider to add this property:

- **GitHub**: [GitHub integration guide](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/examples/resource-mapping-examples#map-repositories-and-pull-requests)
- **GitLab**: [GitLab integration guide](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/gitlab/examples#mapping-projects-readmemd-and-merge-requests)
- **Azure Repos**: [Azure Repos integration guide](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/azure-devops/examples#mapping-repositories-file-contents-repository-policies-and-pull-requests) 

:::

:::tip Adding JSON Schema Using Port's UI
1. **Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model)** in your Port portal.
2. **Click on "+ Blueprint"** to create a new blueprint.
3. **Click on the `{...}` button** in the top right corner, and choose **"Edit JSON"**.
4. **Add this JSON schema** to define the properties and relations needed for your blueprint.

By following these steps, you can paste and manage the JSON schema required to track DORA metrics in Port.

### Tracking strategies
Below are the main ways you can track deployments directly within Port:

<Tabs groupId="deployment-strategies" queryString defaultValue="pr-merge" values={[
{label: "PR/MR Merge", value: "pr-merge"},
{label: "Workflow/Job", value: "workflow-job"},
{label: "CI/CD Pipelines", value: "ci-cd-pipelines"},
{label: "Releases/Tags", value: "releases-tags"},
{label: "Custom API", value: "custom-api"}
]}>

<TabItem value="pr-merge" label="PR/MR Merge">

One of the ways to track deployments is by monitoring when pull requests (PRs)/ merge request (MRs) are merged into a branch,
typically the **main**/**master** branch.
This is the **recommended** approach for tracking deployments and calculating lead time.

The lead time for these merges is calculated as the difference between when the PR/MR was created and when it was merged.

  <Tabs groupId="pr-merge-strategies" defaultValue="github-pr-merge" values={[
  {label: "GitHub", value: "github-pr-merge"},
  {label: "GitLab", value: "gitlab-pr-merge"},
  {label: "Azure Repos", value: "azure-repos-pr-merge"}
  ]}>

  <TabItem value="github-pr-merge" label="GitHub">

  Below is a demonstration of how deployment tracking can be implemented using the PR merge strategy.

  **Example**:

  - When a PR is merged, a **deployment entity** is created in Port to represent the deployment that took place.
  - The **lead time** for that PR is calculated and added to the deployment as part of the blueprint.

  Here’s how you can implement this:

  1. **Add Pull Request blueprint, sample can be found [here](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/examples/resource-mapping-examples/#map-repositories-and-pull-requests)**.

  2. **Add the configuration below** to the [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) in your Port portal, and select your GitHub integration:

  <details>
 <summary><b>Deployment config (click to expand)</b></summary>

 ```yaml showLineNumbers
  - kind: pull-request
    selector:
     query: .base.ref == 'main' and .state == 'closed'  # Track PRs merged into the main branch
    port:
      entity:
        mappings:
          identifier: .head.repo.name + '-' + (.id|tostring)
          title: .head.repo.name + " Deployment"
          blueprint: '"deployment"'
          properties:
           environment: '"Production"'  # Hardcoded value
           createdAt: .merged_at
           deploymentStatus: '"Success"' # Hardcoded value
        relations:

          service: .head.repo.name
 ```

  </details>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="gitlab-pr-merge" label="GitLab">

  Below is a demonstration of how deployment tracking can be implemented using the MR merge strategy:

  **Example**:

  - When a MR is merged, a **deployment entity** is created in Port to represent the deployment that took place.
  - The **lead time** for that MR is calculated and added to the deployment as part of the blueprint.

  Here’s how you can implement this:

  1. **Add Merge Request blueprint, sample can be found [here](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/gitlab/examples#mapping-projects-readmemd-and-merge-requests)**.

  2. **Add the configuration below** to the [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) in your Port portal, and select your GitLab integration:

  <details>
 <summary><b>Deployment config (click to expand)</b></summary>

 ```yaml showLineNumbers
  - kind: merge-request
    selector:
      query: .target_branch == 'main' and .state == 'merged' # Track MRs merged into the main branch
    port:

        mappings:
          identifier: .source_branch + '-' + (.id|tostring)
          title: .source_branch + " Deployment"
          blueprint: '"deployment"'
          properties:
            environment: '"Production"' # Hardcoded value
            createdAt: .merged_at
            deploymentStatus: '"Success"' # Hardcoded value
          relations:
            service: .references.full | gsub("!.+"; "")
            mergeRequest: .id | tostring

 ```

  </details>

:::info Add missing relationship
if you don't have a merge request relationship with the **deployment blueprint** add this sample `json` in relations of the **deployment blueprint** to create that relationship
```json showLineNumbers
    "mergeRequest": {
      "title": "Merge Request",
      "target": "gitlabMergeRequest",
      "required": false,
      "many": false
    }

  <TabItem value="azure-repos-pr-merge" label="Azure Repos">

Below is a demonstration of how deployment tracking can be implemented using the Azure DevOps PR merge strategy:


**Example**:

- When a PR is merged, a **deployment entity** is created in Port to represent the deployment that took place.
- The **lead time** for that PR is calculated and added to the deployment as part of the blueprint.

Here’s how you can implement this:

:::tip Hardcoded values
The value for deploymentStatus is hardcoded to `Success` to treat all deployments as successful,
and the environment is hardcoded to Production for the **main** branch in this example.
You can modify these values based on your requirements.

<TabItem value="workflow-job" label="Workflow/Job">

Track deployments by monitoring workflow runs in your pipeline.
This setup captures all workflow runs from the main branch and maps them to deployment entities. 
The deployment status is set dynamically based on whether the workflow run concluded successfully or failed.

Below is a demonstration of how deployment tracking can be implemented using workflow/job.

  <Tabs groupId="workflow-job-strategies" defaultValue="github-workflow-job" values={[

:::tip Using regex
You can use regex to track only workflows/pipeline related to deployments
(e.g., workflows/pipeline containing the word "deploy" or "CD").
The environment is automatically determined based on the branch, where the main branch corresponds to Production.
:::

This approach can also be implemented for other CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, CircleCI. Each tool allows you to monitor workflows or pipeline runs and map them into Port as deployment entities, ensuring consistency across multiple platforms.

By following a similar pattern for other tools, you will be able to capture deployment metadata, dynamically set the deployment status, and represent all your deployment activities in a unified way in Port.

<TabItem value="ci-cd-pipelines" label="CI/CD Pipelines">

CI/CD pipelines, such as those run by Jenkins, provide a robust way to track deployments. Jenkins, in particular, allows you to create and update entities in Port dynamically using Port's API as part of the pipeline execution.

**Examples**:

Port supports tracking deployments from various CI/CD tools by monitoring pipelines and reporting the deployment status to Port. Here are examples for some commonly used CI/CD tools:

### Monorepo Tracking
By using **custom integrations**, you can effectively track services or components within a monorepo.

Here’s how you can do this:

- **Mapping Service with Monorepo**: You can track the individual services or features within a monorepo by adjusting the mappings associated with the file kind. Each microservice or feature should have distinct properties such as `name`, `deployment status`, and `dependencies`.

- **Ingest Data via Port API**: Use Port's API to track changes, deployments, or pull request merges for each service individually. By using selectors, you can map specific parts of the monorepo (e.g., specific directories) to corresponding services.


The following YAML example demonstrates how to track multiple services (e.g., `service-A`, `service-B`) within a monorepo:

```yaml
resources:
  - kind: repository
    selector:
      query: ".name == 'monorepo' && (.path | startswith('service-A/') || .path | startswith('service-B/'))"
    port:
      entity:
        mappings:
          identifier: .path
          title: .path | split('/')[0]
          blueprint: '"service"'
          properties:
            url: .html_url
            defaultBranch: .default_branch
```

In this setup:
- The `query` checks if the repository is the monorepo and if the file path starts with either `service-A/` or `service-B/`.
- The `identifier` is mapped to the path, which uniquely identifies the service.
- The `title` is derived from the service name in the file path.

By this method, individual services within a monorepo are mapped to Port blueprints.

:::tip Custom Integration Benefits
Custom integrations provide flexibility in mapping and tracking each service or microservice within a monorepo. With Port’s API, you can track deployments and updates for each component separately, giving you granular control over monitoring and managing services in a monorepo.

## Tracking incidents

Incidents are essential for tracking key DORA metrics, including **Change Failure Rate (CFR)** and **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**. Effective incident tracking reveals insights into how frequently deployments fail and how quickly teams can resolve issues. This section outlines how to:

- Use incidents to calculate **CFR** and **MTTR**.
- Link incidents to services to track the impact of failures.
- Aggregate metrics across incidents for better monitoring.

### Data model setup

Ensure that your **PagerDuty incident blueprint** is properly configured to map incidents to the correct services(gitHub). 
This includes defining the appropriate properties and relations for incidents.Follow this [PagerDuty Incident Blueprint Setup Link](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/pagerduty#incident-blueprint-setup) to implement.

- Add the following properties to capture incident resolution time and recovery time:

   <details>
   <summary><b>Additional properties for PagerDuty Incident Blueprint (click to expand)</b></summary>
   
   ```json showLineNumbers
    "resolvedAt": {
      "title": "Incident Resolution Time",
      "type": "string",
      "format": "date-time",
      "description": "The timestamp when the incident was resolved"
    },
    "recoveryTime": {
      "title": "Time to Recovery",
      "type": "number",
      "description": "The time (in minutes) between the incident being triggered and resolved"
    }
   
   ```
   </details>

- Add this mapping config to pagerduty incident [data source](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources):

   <details>
     <summary><b>Incident mapping config for resolvedAt and recoveryTime (click to expand)</b></summary>

      recoveryTime: >-
         (.created_at as $createdAt | .resolved_at as $resolvedAt |
         if $resolvedAt == null then null else 
         ( ($resolvedAt | strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") | mktime) -
           ($createdAt | strptime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ") | mktime) ) / 60 end) # Time in minutes and divide by 3600 if you want it calculated in hours
     ```
   
   </details>

### Syncing incidents with PagerDuty and other tools

To sync incidents from **PagerDuty**, follow the steps in the [PagerDuty guide](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/pagerduty). The guide provides detailed steps for setting up integrations to track incidents related to deployments.

For other incident management tools, follow these respective guides:
- [OpsGenie](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/opsgenie)
- [FireHydrant](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/firehydrant)

:::tip Mapping Incidents to Services
we use the **search relation** entity to map the `pagerdutyIncident` blueprint to the correct service based on the service's `$title` and the pagerduty incident `service.summary`.
We have assumed that the **service name/title** exists in the `service.summary` property of the incident, but you can modify this query to map based on other properties that better match your setup

Using Search Queries](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-mapping/#mapping-relations-using-search-queries).

## Metrics

We will now aggregate the **DORA metrics** at the **service level**, allowing us to track metrics such as **Deployment Frequency**, **Change Lead Time**, **Change Failure Rate (CFR)**, and **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)** for each service.

:::note Metrics Aggregation
If you want to track these metrics at higher levels, such as **team** or **domain**, makes sure the appropriate **team** or **domain** blueprints exist, and that they have relationships defined with the **service** blueprint. Then, you can apply the aggregation properties for these higher hierarchies, similar to how we are doing for the **service** blueprint below.
:::

###  Aggregation
The metrics in this guide are aggregated monthly. However, you can easily switch the timeframes to weekly, hourly, etc., based on your requirements.

:::tip Adding Aggregation to Blueprints

Before proceeding, follow these steps to add the aggregation and calculation properties to the **Service Blueprint**:

1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) in your Port portal.
2. Locate and select your **Service** blueprint.
3. Click the `{...}` button in the top right corner, and choose **Edit JSON**.
4. Insert the respective **aggregation** or **calculation properties** under the `aggregationProperties` or `calculationProperties` section in the Service blueprint's JSON schema.
5. Save your changes to apply the new aggregation configuration.

:::tip Metric widget groupings
It would be visually cleaner and more informative to group related widgets, such as the **Line Chart** and **Number Chart** widgets, side by side for easier comparison.
You can replicate more examples by checking our dora metrics dashboard on the [demo environment](https://demo.getport.io/dora_metrics).
