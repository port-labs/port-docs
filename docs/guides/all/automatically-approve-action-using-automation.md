# Automating Self Service Action Approvals

In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up an automated approval system for Self-Service Actions (SSAs). We'll use a specific example of a permissions request system that you can easily adapt to your needs.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Access to your Port account
- Permissions to create and edit Self-Service Actions and Automations
- A basic understanding of JSON and JQ expressions

## Creating the Self-Service Action

Let's start by creating a Self-Service Action for requesting permissions:

1. Navigate to the **Self-Service** section in your Port dashboard.
2. Click on "+ Action" to create a new SSA.
3. Use the following example JSON structure for your action:

```json
{
  "identifier": "request_permissions",
  "title": "Self Service - Request Permissions",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "self-service",
    "operation": "CREATE",
    "userInputs": {
      "properties": {
        "permissions": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "Permissions",
          "enum": [
            "ReadOnly",
            "ReadWrite"
          ],
          "enumColors": {
            "ReadOnly": "lightGray",
            "ReadWrite": "lightGray"
          }
        }
      },
      "required": [],
      "order": []
    }
  },
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "SLACK",
    "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/xyz",
    "agent": false,
    "synchronized": true,
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {},
    "body": {
      "text": "\nHello from Port :slightly_smiling_face:\n\n:white_circle:   Read more about Slack wehooks <https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks%7Chere.>\n\n:white_circle:   Read more about formating your message <https://api.slack.com/reference/surfaces/formatting%7Chere.>\n\nThis message was triggered by {{ .trigger.by.user.email }}"
    }
  },
  "requiredApproval": {
    "type": "ANY"
  },
  "approvalNotification": {
    "type": "email"
  }
}
```


This SSA configuration does the following:

- Defines an action with the identifier "request_permissions"
- Sets up user inputs for selecting permission types (ReadOnly or ReadWrite)
- Configures a Slack webhook invocation method to notify about new requests
- Specifies that approval is required
- Sets up email notifications for approvals

## Setting Up the Automation

Now that we have our SSA, let's create an automation to automatically approve certain requests:

1. In the Port builder, click on **+ Automation**.
2. Use the following JSON structure for your automation:

```json
{
  "identifier": "auto-approve",
  "title": "Auto Approve",
  "description": "Auto Approve",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "automation",
    "event": {
      "type": "RUN_CREATED",
      "actionIdentifier": "request_permissions"
    },
    "condition": {
      "type": "JQ",
      "expressions": [
        ".diff.after.properties.permissions == \"ReadOnly\""
      ],
      "combinator": "and"
    }
  },
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "WEBHOOK",
    "url": "https://api.getport.io/v1/actions/runs/{{ .event.diff.after.id }}/approval",
    "agent": false,
    "synchronized": true,
    "method": "PATCH",
    "headers": {},
    "body": {
      "status": "APPROVE",
      "description": "auto approved by automation"
    }
  },
  "publish": true
}
```


This automation configuration:

- Triggers when a new run of the "request_permissions" action is created
- Checks if the requested permission type is "ReadOnly"
- If the condition is met, it automatically approves the request via Port's API

## How It Works

When a user submits a permissions request:

- If they select **ReadOnly**, the automation triggers and automatically approves the request.
- If they select **ReadWrite**, the automation doesn't trigger, and the request requires manual approval.

The automation uses a JQ expression to check the permission type:

`.diff.after.properties.permissions == "ReadOnly"`

When the condition is met, it sends a PATCH request to Port's API to approve the action run.

## Customizing the Automation

You can customize the automation to fit your specific needs:

- **Modify the condition**: Change the JQ expression to check for different properties or values.
- **Add multiple conditions**: Use the combinator field to combine multiple expressions with "and" or "or" logic.
- **Customize the approval message**: Modify the description in the webhook body to provide more context.


## Best Practices

To ensure your automated approval system works smoothly and securely:

- **Match identifiers**: Ensure the `actionIdentifier` in the automation matches the identifier of your SSA (in this case, "request_permissions").
- **Thorough testing**: Test the automation with various inputs to ensure it only auto-approves intended requests.
- **Regular monitoring**: Set up alerts or periodic checks to ensure the system functions as expected.
- **Security measures**: Implement additional checks for sensitive operations, such as user role verification.
- **Documentation**: Keep your team informed about which actions are auto-approved and under what conditions.

Remember to regularly review and update your automation rules as your processes evolve. This ensures your automated system remains efficient and secure.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Port's automation capabilities, we've created an efficient, secure workflow that reduces manual overhead for permission requests. This system streamlines the approval process for **ReadOnly** permissions while ensuring that **ReadWrite** requests still go through manual review.

We're excited to see how you'll use this feature to improve your team's productivity and streamline your permission management processes!
