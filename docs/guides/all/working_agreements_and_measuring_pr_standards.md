# Measuring pull request standards
This guide is aimed at helping engineering teams implement working agreements and measure pull request (PR) standards.  
We will implement working agreements using Port's scorecards and measure PR standards using aggregation properties.  
By the end of this guide, you will be able to track teams' performance based on pull requests metrics as shown here:


<img src='/img/guides/teamPRMetricTable.png' border='1px' />


## Overview
Effective collaboration and clear expectations are crucial for high-performing engineering teams.  
**Working agreements** establish shared processes and standards, enhancing teamwork.

Measuring **Pull request (PR)** standards is essential for assessing code quality, review processes, and team efficiency.

By integrating working agreements with measurable PR metrics, teams can monitor adherence to best practices and continuously improve workflows.

We will discuss how to implement working agreements and measure PR standards using Port.



:::info Metrics
Metrics are essential for assessing how well teams adhere to their working agreements.  
They enable teams to track compliance, identify bottlenecks, and drive continuous improvement.

For detailed insights into key metrics like `deployment frequency`, `lead time for changes`, and `change failure rate`,  
please refer to our [DORA Metrics guide](/guides/all/setup-dora-metrics).
:::


## Prerequisites
- Complete the [Port onboarding process](https://docs.getport.io/quickstart).
- Access to a GitHub repository that is connected to Port via the onboarding process.



## Working agreements

The following working agreements and PR checks have been implemented in our [demo environment](https://demo.getport.io/scorecard_overviewl):

- [**PR Description Cannot be Empty**](#pr-description-cannot-be-empty): Ensures that every PR has a description.
- [**PR Has Linked Issue**](#pr-has-linked-issue): Verifies that each PR is linked to an issue.
- [**PR Has No Unchecked Checkboxes**](#pr-has-no-unchecked-checkboxes): Checks that there are no unchecked items in the PR description.
- [**PR Requires Reviewers**](#pr-requires-reviewers): Confirms that at least one reviewer is assigned to the PR.
- [**PR Is Linked to a Milestone**](#pr-is-linked-to-a-milestone): Ensures the PR is associated with a milestone.
- [**PR Changed X Files or Less**](#pr-changed-x-files-or-less): Validates that the number of changed files is within acceptable limits.
- [**PR Has Been Open for X Days**](#pr-has-been-open-for-x-days): Monitors how long a PR has been open.
- [**PR Batch Size Calculation**](#pr-batch-size-calculation): Calculates the batch size of the PR.

These checks are implemented using Port's [scorecards](/promote-scorecards/).


## Implementation 
This section will guide you through implementing the working agreements and PR checks in your Port environment.
Follow the steps below:
1. Add the properties to the `pull request` blueprint.
   - Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) in your Port portal.
   -  Select the `pull request` blueprint.
   -  Click on the `...` button in the top right corner, and choose "Edit JSON".
   - Add the properties and mapping configurations as described below.
   - Save the changes.
   
   <br/>
   
   :::tip Expected JSON  
     This is the expected JSON definition after adding the properties.
     <img src='/img/guides/prBPPropertyAdd.png'  width='80%' border="1px" />
   :::
<br/>
2. Add the **mapping configuration** to the data source.
   - Go to the [Data Sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) in your Port portal.
   - Select the data source connected to your GitHub repository
   - Add the mapping configurations as described below.
     <img src='/img/guides/addMappingConfigDS.png' border="1px"  />
   - Save the changes.

3. Add the **scorecard** definitions to the `pull request` blueprint.
   - Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) in your Port portal.
   - Select the `pull request` blueprint.
   - Click on  the **Scorecard**
   - Click on the `+ New Scorecard` button.
   <img src='/img/guides/scorecardOnPRAdd.png' border="1px" />
   - Paste the scorecard definitions as described below.
   - Save the changes.

## Pull request metrics aggregation

To measure PR standards effectively, add aggregation properties on the **service**  blueprint.
This will allow us to capture important metrics such as:

- PR Average Duration (Service Level)
- PRs Opened (Service & Organization Level)
- PRs Merged (Service & Organization Level)
- Average Commits per PR (Service & Organization Level)
- Average Lines of Code (LOC) Changed (Service & Organization Level)
<br/>
::::info Aggregation on higher hierarchy
- To aggregate on an organization level, apply the same settings to a higher hierarchy.
- If you want to see it on a team level, you need to make sure services are related to teams and add the same aggregations to team
::::


:::tip Adding Aggregation to Blueprints
To add aggregation properties to your blueprints, follow these steps:
1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) in your Port portal.
2. Locate and select your **blueprint**.
3. Click the `{...}` button in the top right corner, and choose **Edit JSON**.
4. Insert the respective **aggregation** or **calculation properties** under the `aggregationProperties` or `calculationProperties` section in the blueprint's JSON schema.
5. Save your changes to apply the new aggregation configuration.
