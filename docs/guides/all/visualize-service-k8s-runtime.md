# Visualize your services' k8s runtime

Port‚Äôs Kubernetes integration helps you model and visualize your cluster‚Äôs workloads alongside your existing workloads in Port. This guide will help you set up the integration and visualize your services' Kubernetes runtime.

## Common use cases

- Developers can easily view the health and status of their services' K8s runtime.
- Platform engineers can create custom views and dashboards for different stakeholders.
- Platform engineers can set, maintain, and track standards for Kubernetes resources.
- R&D managers can track data about services' Kubernetes resources, enabling high-level oversight and better decision-making.

## Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a Port account and that you have finished the [onboarding process](/getting-started/overview). We will use the `Workload` blueprint that was created during the onboarding process.
- You will need an accessible k8s cluster. If you don't have one, here is how to quickly set-up a [minikube cluster](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) - required to install Port's Kubernetes exporter.


## Set up data model

To integrate Kubernetes resources with your existing `Workload` blueprint, we‚Äôll first install Port‚Äôs Kubernetes exporter, which automatically creates Kubernetes-related blueprints and entities in Port. 


### Install Port's Kubernetes exporter

<OceanRealtimeInstallation integration="Kubernetes" />

<PortApiRegionTip/>

#### What does the exporter do?

After installation, the exporter will:

1. Create <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprints</PortTooltip> in your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) (as defined [here](https://github.com/port-labs/port-k8s-exporter/blob/main/assets/defaults/blueprints.json)) that represent Kubernetes resources:

    <img src='/img/guides/k8sBlueprintsCreated.png' width='95%' />

    <br/><br/>

    :::info What is K8sWorkload?

    `K8sWorkload` is an abstraction of Kubernetes objects which create and manage pods (e.g. `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `DaemonSet`).

    :::

    <br/>

2. Create <PortTooltip id="entity">entities</PortTooltip> in your [Software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services). You will see a new page for each <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprint</PortTooltip> containing your resources, filled with data from your Kubernetes cluster (according to the default mapping that is defined [here](https://github.com/port-labs/port-k8s-exporter/blob/main/assets/defaults/appConfig.yaml)):

    <img src='/img/guides/k8sEntitiesCreated.png' width='100%' />

    <br/><br/>

3. Create <PortTooltip id="scorecard">scorecards</PortTooltip> for the blueprints that represent your K8s resources (as defined [here](https://github.com/port-labs/port-k8s-exporter/blob/main/assets/defaults/scorecards.json)). These scorecards define rules and checks over the data ingested from your K8s cluster, making it easy to check that your K8s resources meet your standards.

4. Create dashboards that provide you with a visual view of the data ingested from your K8s cluster.

5. Listen to changes in your Kubernetes cluster and update your <PortTooltip id="entity">entities</PortTooltip> accordingly.

<br/>


## Set up automatic discovery

After installing the integration, the relationship between the **Workload** blueprint and the **k8_workload** blueprint is established automatically. To ensure each **Workload** entity is properly related to its respective **k8_workload** entity, we will configure automatic discovery using labels.


In this guide we will use the following convention:  
A `k8_workload` with a label in the form of `portWorkload: <workload-identifier>` will automatically be assigned to a `Workload` with that identifier.


For example, a k8s deployment with the label `portWorkload: myWorkload` will be assigned to a `Workload` with the identifier `myWorkload`.

We achieved this by adding a [mapping definition](https://github.com/port-labs/template-assets/blob/main/kubernetes/full-configs/k8s-guide/k8s_guide_config.yaml#L111-L119) in the configuration YAML we used when installing the exporter. The definition uses `jq` to perform calculations between properties.

**Let's see this in action:**

1. Create a `Deployment` resource in your cluster with a label matching the identifier of a `Workload` in your [Software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services).  
   You can use the simple example below and change the `metadata.labels.portWorkload` value to match your desired `Workload`. Copy it into a file named `deployment.yaml`, then apply it:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
    ```

    <details>
    <summary><b>Deployment example (Click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```yaml showLineNumbers
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
        name: awesomeapp
        labels:
            app: nginx
            portWorkload: AwesomeWorkload
        spec:
        replicas: 2
        selector:
            matchLabels:
            app: nginx
        template:
            metadata:
            labels:
                app: nginx
            spec:
            containers:
                - name: nginx
                image: nginx:1.14.2
                resources:
                    limits:
                    cpu: "200m"
                    memory: "256Mi"
                    requests:
                    cpu: "100m"
                    memory: "128Mi"
                ports:
                    - containerPort: 80
    ```

    </details>

    <br/>

2. To see the new data, we need to update the mapping configuration that the K8s exporter uses to ingest data.  
   To edit the mapping, go to your [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources), find the K8s exporter card, click on it and you will see a YAML editor showing the current configuration.
     
   Add the following block to the mapping configuration and click `Resync`:

    ```yaml showLineNumbers
    resources:
      # ... Other resource mappings installed by the K8s exporter
    - kind: apps/v1/deployments
      selector:
        query: .metadata.namespace | startswith("kube") | not
      port:
        entity:
          mappings:
            - identifier: .metadata.labels.portWorkload
              title: .metadata.name
              blueprint: '"workload"'
              relations:
                k8s_workload: >-
                  .metadata.name + "-Deployment-" + .metadata.namespace + "-" +
                  env.CLUSTER_NAME
    ```

    <br/>

3. Go to your [Software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services), and click on `Workloads`. Click on the `Workload` for which you created the deployment, and you should see the `k8_workload` relation filled.

## Visualize data from your Kubernetes environment

We now have a lot of data about our workloads, and some metrics to track their quality. 
Let's see how we can visualize this information in ways that will benefit the routine of our developers and managers.
Let's start by creating a few widgets that will help us keep track of our services' health and availability.

### Add an "Unhealthy services" table to your homepage

In the configuration provided for this guide, a `workload` is considered `Healthy` if its defined number of replicas is equal to its available replicas (of course, you can change this definition).

1. Go to your [homepage](https://app.getport.io/home), click on the `+ Widget` button in the top right corner, then select `Table`.

2. Fill the form out like this, then click `Save`:

    <img src='/img/guides/k8sHomepageTableUnhealthyServices.png' width='50%' />

    <br/><br/>

3. In your new table, click on `Filter`, then on `+ Add new filter`. Fill out the fields like this:

    <img src='/img/guides/k8sHomepageTableFilterUnhealthy.png' width='50%' />

    <br/><br/>

Now you can keep track of services that need your attention right from your homepage.

  <img src='/img/guides/k8sHomepageTableUnhealthyFilter.png' width='70%' />

  _These services were not included in this guide, but serve to show an example of how this table might look._


### Use your scorecards to get a clear overview of your workloads' availability

In the configuration provided for this guide, the availability metric is defined like this:

  - Bronze: >=1 replica
  - Silver: >=2 replicas
  - Gold: >=3 replicas

To get an overall picture of our workloads' availability, we can use a table operation.

1. Go to the [`Workloads` catalog page](https://app.getport.io/workloads).

2. Click on the `Group by` button, then choose `High availability` from the dropdown:

    <img src='/img/guides/k8sGroupByAvailability.png' width='40%' />

    <br/><br/>

3. Click on any of the metric levels to see the corresponding workloads:

    <img src='/img/guides/k8sWorkloadsAfterGroupByAvailability.png' width='90%' />

    <br/><br/>

Note that you can also set this as the default view by click on the `Save this view` button üìù

## Possible daily routine integrations

- Send a slack message in the R&D channel to let everyone know that a new deployment was created.
- Notify Devops engineers when a service's availability drops.
- Send a weekly/monthly report to R&D managers displaying the health of services' production runtime.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes is a complex environment that requires high-quality observability. Port's Kubernetes integration allows you to easily model and visualize your Kubernetes resources, and integrate them into your daily routine.  
Customize your views to display the data that matters to you, grouped or filtered by teams, namespaces, or any other criteria.  
With Port, you can seamlessly fit your organization's needs, and create a single source of truth for your Kubernetes resources.
