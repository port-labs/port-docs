# Ensure production readiness

This guide will walk you through configuring production readiness standards for your services.  
You'll learn how to track metrics like on-call coverage and code ownership, and integrate them with your deployment process.

## Common use cases

- Platform engineers will be able to define clear policies for services, and automatically pass/fail releases accordingly.
- Developers will be able to easily see which policies are not met, and what they need to fix.
- R&D managers will have a bird's-eye view of service health and compliance.


## Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a Port account and that you have finished the [onboarding process](/getting-started/overview). We will use the `service` blueprint that was created during the onboarding process.
- The [Git Integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/) that is relevant for you needs to be installed.
- The [PagerDuty integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/pagerduty/) needs to be installed.


## Set up data model

When you install the PagerDuty and Git integration, Port will automatically add the following properties to your service blueprint:
- `pagerduty_oncall`: Shows the current on-call for the service (from PagerDuty)
- `require_code_owner_review`: Indicates if code owner review is required (from Git)

We'll use these properties in our metrics to track production readiness standards.

## Configure PagerDuty service mapping

To ensure your PagerDuty services are correctly mapped to your Port services, you'll need to configure the mapping in your PagerDuty integration. This will allow Port to automatically discover and relate PagerDuty services to your existing service entities.

1. Go to your [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) and click on your PagerDuty integration

    <img src='/img/guides/pdDataSources.png' width='100%' border='1px' />
    <br/><br/>

2. Add the following mapping configuration:
      ```yaml showLineNumbers
      - kind: services
        selector:
          query: "true"
        port:
          entity:
            mappings:
              identifier: .name | gsub("[^a-zA-Z0-9@_.:/=-]"; "-") | tostring
              title: .name
              blueprint: '"service"'
              properties: {}
              relations:
                pager_duty_service: .id
      ```


## Update your existing service's scorecard
Now let's use the mirror properties created from the pagerduty and git installations to set standards for our services.
Say we want to ensure each service meets our new requirements, with different levels of importance. Our `Service` blueprint already has a scorecard called `Production readiness`, with three rules.  

Let's add our metrics to it:
- `Bronze` - each service must have a `Readme`
- `Silver` - each service must have code owner reviews enabled
- `Gold` - each service must have an on-call defined

Now let's implement it:

1. Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model), choose the `Service` <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprint</PortTooltip>, click on `Scorecards`, then click our existing `Production readiness` scorecard:

    <img src='/img/guides/editReadinessScorecard.png' width='30%' />
    
    <br/><br/>

2. Replace the content with this, then click `Save`:

    <details>
    <summary><b>Scorecard schema (click to expand)</b></summary>
    
    ```json showLineNumbers

        }
      ]

    ```
    
    </details>

3. Now go to your Catalog and click on any of your services.  

4. Click on the `Scorecards` tab and you will see the score of the service, with details of which checks passed/failed:

These widgets will give you a comprehensive view of your services' production readiness status, making it easy to identify areas that need attention.

## Possible daily routine integrations

- Use Port's API to check for scorecard compliance from your CI and pass/fail it accordingly.
- Notify periodically via Slack about services that fail gold/silver/bronze validations.
- Send a weekly/monthly report for managers showing the number of services that do not meet specific standards.

## Conclusion

Production readiness is something that needs to be monitored and handled constantly. In a microservice-heavy environment, things like codeowners and on-call management are critical.  
With Port, standards are easy to set-up, prioritize and track. Using Port's API, you can also create/get/modify your scorecards from anywhere, allowing seamless integration with other platforms and services in your environment.
