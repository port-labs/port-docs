# Ensure production readiness

This guide will walk you through configuring production readiness standards for your services.  
You'll learn how to track metrics like on-call coverage and code ownership, and integrate them with your deployment process.

## Common use cases

- Platform engineers will be able to define clear policies for services, and automatically pass/fail releases accordingly.
- Developers will be able to easily see which policies are not met, and what they need to fix.
- R&D managers will have a bird's-eye view of service health and compliance.


## Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a Port account and that you have finished the [onboarding process](/quickstart). We will use the `service` blueprint that was created during the onboarding process.
- The [Git Integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/) that is relevant for you needs to be installed.
- The [PagerDuty integration](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/incident-management/pagerduty/) needs to be installed.


## Set up data model

When you install the PagerDuty and Git integrations, they automatically add useful properties to your service blueprint:
- `pagerduty_oncall`: Shows the current on-call for the service (from PagerDuty)
- `require_code_owner_review`: Indicates if code owner review is required (from Git)

We'll use these properties to track production readiness standards.

### Set up PagerDuty integration

Port offers various integrations with incident response platforms. In this guide, we will use **Pagerduty** to get our services' on-call.

:::tip Skip if already installed
If you have already installed the PagerDuty integration you can skip this step.

#### Integrate Pagerduty into Port

Let's bring our Pagerduty data into Port. Port's Pagerduty integration automatically fetches `Services` and `Incidents`, and creates <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprints</PortTooltip> and <PortTooltip id="entity">entities</PortTooltip> for them.  
To install the integration:

1. Go to your [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources), and click on the `+ Data source` button in the top-right corner.

2. Under the `Incident Management` section, choose `Pagerduty`.

3. Port supports multiple installation methods, for this guide we will use "Hosted by port". You can use OAuth for a quick and easy installation.

4. Enter the required parameters:
   - Token - Your Pagerduty API token. To create one, see the [Pagerduty documentation](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/api-access-keys).
     
      :::info Port secrets
      The `Token` field is a Port secret, meaning it will be encrypted and stored securely in Port.  
      Select a secret from the dropdown, or create a new one by clicking on `+ Add secret`.

      Learn more about Port secrets [here](/sso-rbac/port-secrets/).  
      :::

   - API URL - The Pagerduty API URL. For most users, this will be `https://api.pagerduty.com`. If you use the EU data centers, set this to `https://api.eu.pagerduty.com`.

5. Click `Done`. Port will now install the integration and start fetching your Pagerduty data. This may take a few minutes.    
   You can see the integration in the `Data sources` page, when ready it will look like this:
   <img src='/img/guides/prodReadinessInstallationCompleteDataSources.png' width='75%' border='1px' />
   <br/><br/>


Great! Now that the integration is installed, we should see some new components in Port:

   - Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model), you should now see two new <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprints</PortTooltip> created by the integration - `PagerDuty Service` and `PagerDuty Incident`.
   - Go to your [Software catalog](https://app.getport.io/services), click on `PagerDuty Services` in the sidebar to see your PagerDuty services with populated `On-call` properties.


### Set up Git integration

Port's Git integration automatically fetches repository data, including branch protection rules. This allows us to track if code owner review is required for each repository.

:::tip Skip if already installed
If you have already installed the Git integration you can skip this step.
:::

To install the Git integration, follow the [Git integration guide](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git).

Once installed, Port will automatically track the `require_code_owner_review` property for your repositories, which we'll use in our scorecard rules.


## Update your existing service's scorecard
Now let's use the mirror properties created from the pagerduty and git installations to set standards for our services.
Say we want to ensure each service meets our new requirements, with different levels of importance. Our `Service` blueprint already has a scorecard called `Production readiness`, with three rules.  

Let's add our metrics to it:
- `Bronze` - each service must have a `Readme`
- `Silver` - each service must have code owner reviews enabled
- `Gold` - each service must have an on-call defined

Now let's implement it:

1. Go to your [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model), choose the `Service` <PortTooltip id="blueprint">blueprint</PortTooltip>, click on `Scorecards`, then click our existing `Production readiness` scorecard:

    <img src='/img/guides/editReadinessScorecard.png' width='30%' />
    
    <br/><br/>

2. Replace the content with this, then click `Save`:

            ]

                "operator": "isNotEmpty",
                "property": "on_call"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    </details>

3. Now go to your Catalog and click on any of your services.  

4. Click on the `Scorecards` tab and you will see the score of the service, with details of which checks passed/failed:

    <img src='/img/guides/prodReadinessEntityAfterScorecard.png' width='100%' border='1px' />

## Possible daily routine integrations

- Use Port's API to check for scorecard compliance from your CI and pass/fail it accordingly.
- Notify periodically via Slack about services that fail gold/silver/bronze validations.
- Send a weekly/monthly report for managers showing the number of services that do not meet specific standards.

## Conclusion

Production readiness is something that needs to be monitored and handled constantly. In a microservice-heavy environment, things like codeowners and on-call management are critical.  
With Port, standards are easy to set-up, prioritize and track. Using Port's API, you can also create/get/modify your scorecards from anywhere, allowing seamless integration with other platforms and services in your environment.
