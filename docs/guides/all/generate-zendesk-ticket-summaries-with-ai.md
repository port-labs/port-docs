# Summarize Zendesk tickets with AI

When working on support, you often need quick, structured summaries of a ticket for internal handoffs or customer updates.  
In this guide, we will set up a prompt in Port so that any AI tool that supports the prompt feature of the MCP protocol can help you summarize Zendesk tickets with all the relevant context.

## Common use cases

- Generate a concise, standardized ticket summary for internal handoffs.
- Produce a customer-facing summary capturing request, resolution, and root cause.
- Create quick recaps for weekly reviews or QA of support interactions.

## Scenario

You’re the on-call support engineer. A customer requests the ability to set labels for tickets on Zendesk ticket `4095`. Before hand-off, you need a concise internal summary and a customer-facing version.

Example context snippets the prompt will fetch:

```text
Ticket subject: Add the ability to set labels for tickets

Recent comments
- 2025-08-13 13:12: Customer: "I want the ability to set labels for tickets"
- 2025-08-13 13:16: Agent: "Thanks for reaching out! Can you share a bit more about how you’d like to use these labels?"
```

Example output from the prompt:

## Flow overview

<br/><br/>

- Developer runs the reusable `zendesk_ticket_summary` prompt with `ticket_id`
- Prompt uses actions to fetch comments and side conversations → returns a structured summary

## Prerequisites

- Port remote MCP installed and connected in your IDE (Cursor, Claude, etc.). Follow the setup guide: [Port MCP Server - Setup](/ai-interfaces/port-mcp-server/overview-and-installation#installing-port-mcp)
- A Port account and have completed the [onboarding process](https://docs.port.io/getting-started/overview).
- Custom integration to ingest Zendesk tickets using [Port webhooks](/build-your-software-catalog/custom-integration/webhook).

## Add Secrets

The actions in this guide authenticate to Zendesk using a secret that stores your API token, enabling them to retrieve ticket comments and side-conversation data. You can generate an API token by following Zendesk’s instructions [here](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/introduction/security-and-auth/#api-token).

To add the secret to your portal:

    1. Click on the `...` button in the top right corner of your Port application.

    2. Click on **Credentials**.

    3. Click on the `Secrets` tab.

    4. Click on `+ Secret` and add the following secrets:
        - `ZENDESK_TOKEN` - Your Zendesk API token generated according to the guide.

## Set up self-service actions

Zendesk tickets consist of two main sources:

1. **Comments** – the primary conversation between the requester and agents (public or internal).
2. **Side conversations** – separate threaded discussions (email, Slack, etc.) opened from the ticket for additional stakeholders.

<img src='/img/guides/zendeskTicketExample.png' border="1px" width="100%" />


The self-service actions you’ll create below retrieve both comments and side-conversation messages, ensuring the prompt has the complete context before generating a summary.

5. Click `Save`.

Replace `<your_subdomain>` with your Zendesk subdomain, for example: `https://acme.zendesk.com/...`.

## Create a reusable prompt

We will now define a prompt entity that your IDE can invoke via [Port MCP](/ai-interfaces/port-mcp-server/prompts). Once created, you can run it with the ticket ID, and it will gather context and produce a structured summary.

1. Go to the [Prompts page](https://app.getport.io/prompts) in Port.
2. Click `Create prompt`.
3. Toggle JSON mode.
4. Paste the following JSON and adjust if needed.

    <details>
    <summary><b>Prompt entity: Zendesk Ticket Summary (Click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
        "identifier": "zendesk_ticket_summary",
        "title": "Zendesk Ticket Summary",
        "icon": "AI",
        "properties": {
            "description": "Summarize a Zendesk support ticket using comments and side conversations",
            "arguments": [
                {
                    "name": "ticket_id",
                    "required": true,
                    "description": "The Zendesk ticket ID to summarize"
                }
            ],
            "template": "You are an AI assistant tasked with summarizing Zendesk support tickets in Port. Use the comments and the side conversations on the ticket to summarize it in the following format:\n\n## Request\nWhat the customer wanted in a short sentence\n\n## Resolution  \nWhat was the resolution\n\n## Root Cause\nIn case of a problem/bug, what was the root cause\n\n## Recommendations\nE.g., update docs, improve error messages, etc.\n\nInstructions for data gathering:\n- To get the comments and side conversations, send empty properties and use the entity identifier: {{ticket_id}}\n- To use the side conversations, you first need to get their URLs and then get the messages sent in them\n- No need to send an entity identifier for side conversation messages, only the side conversation URL in the properties\n\nTicket ID to analyze: {{ticket_id}}"
        },
        "relations": {}
    }
    ```

    </details>

5. Click `Create`.



### Test the workflow

1. In Port, make sure there is a `zendesk_ticket` entity whose `identifier` matches a real Zendesk ticket ID you want to summarize.
2. In your IDE assistant, choose **Port MCP** as the provider as described [here](/ai-interfaces/port-mcp-server/overview-and-installation#installing-port-mcp).
3. Run the `zendesk_ticket_summary` prompt with `ticket_id` set to that Zendesk ticket ID.
4. The assistant will automatically execute the self-service actions to fetch comments and side conversations, then return a structured summary.

## Best practices

- Adjust the prompt to how you’d ideally want to receive a ticket summary—whether that’s a short bullet list or a detailed customer-facing recap.
- Extend the prompt with specific preferences, such as ignoring non-informative system/autoresponder comments or highlighting key fields.
- Use consistent formatting so summaries are scannable across tickets.
- Consider variants: internal vs customer-facing tone; enforce English or match ticket locale.
