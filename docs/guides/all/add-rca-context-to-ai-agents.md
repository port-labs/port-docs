# Add RCA context to AI agents

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to provide additional context to your AI agents beyond what's available through Port's integrations.   

For this guide, we will leverage on the [Incident Manager AI agent](/guides/all/setup-incident-manager-ai-agent) by adding **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** documents to enable it to reference past incidents and their resolutions when answering questions.

## Common use cases

- Provide historical context when responding to new incidents that are similar to past ones.
- Reference documented solutions and preventive measures from previous incidents.
- Help identify patterns across multiple incidents and suggest proactive measures.
- Store and access organizational knowledge in runbooks, architecture documents, and best practices.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have:
- A Port account with the [AI agents feature enabled](/ai-interfaces/ai-agents/overview#access-to-the-feature).
- An existing [Incident Manager AI agent](/guides/all/setup-incident-manager-ai-agent) (or similar).

## Set up data model

For this guide, we will create a custom blueprint to store RCA documents, populate it with sample data, and configure an existing AI agent to access this context.  

<h3> Create Root Cause Analysis blueprint</h3>

We will create a custom blueprint to store RCA documents, populate it with sample data, and configure an existing AI agent to access this context.  

Follow the steps below to create the blueprint:

1. Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.

2. Click on `+ Blueprint`.

3. Click on `{...} Edit JSON`.

4. Copy and paste the JSON schema from below:

    <details>
    <summary>`Root Cause Analysis` blueprint</summary>

    The entities of this blueprint will represent different RCA documents from past incidents.

    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
    "identifier": "rootCauseAnalysis",
    "title": "Root Cause Analysis",
    "icon": "Bug",
    "schema": {

5. Click `Create` to save the blueprint.



<h3> Populate with sample RCA data</h3>

Now let's populate the RCA blueprint with sample data that our AI agent can reference. You can ingest this data using any of these three methods:

<Tabs groupId="ingestion-method" queryString defaultValue="ui" values={[
{label: "Port UI", value: "ui"},
{label: "API", value: "api"},
{label: "Webhook", value: "webhook"}
]}>

<TabItem value="ui">

<h4> Database Connection Pool Exhaustion incident</h4>

Let's create our first RCA entity using the Port UI:

1. Go to your [software catalog](https://app.getport.io/organization).

2. Find the "Root Cause Analysis" tab and click on `+ Root Cause Analysis`.

3. Toggle JSON mode and copy and paste the following JSON:
    <details>

<h4> Memory Leak incident</h4>

Let us add another RCA entity:

1. Click on `+ Root Cause Analysis`.

2. Toggle JSON mode and copy and paste the following JSON:

    <details>
    <summary>Memory Leak incident</summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers

<TabItem value="api">

<h4> Database Connection Pool Exhaustion incident</h4>

You can create RCA entities programmatically using Port's API. This approach is useful for:
- **Bulk imports**: Adding multiple RCA documents at once
- **CI/CD integration**: Automatically creating RCAs as part of your deployment pipeline
- **Custom scripts**: Building tools to migrate data from existing systems

**Where to run this code:**
- **Local scripts**: Run on your development machine for one-time imports
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Integrate into GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins jobs
- **Automation servers**: Deploy as scheduled jobs or triggered workflows
- **Migration tools**: Part of data migration scripts when moving from other systems

First, get your API credentials and token:

```python showLineNumbers title="Create RCA entity via API"
import requests

# Get API token
CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'
API_URL = 'https://api.getport.io/v1'

credentials = {'clientId': CLIENT_ID, 'clientSecret': CLIENT_SECRET}
token_response = requests.post(f'{API_URL}/auth/access_token', json=credentials)
access_token = token_response.json()['accessToken']

headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}'}

<h4> Create webhook integration</h4>

You can automatically create RCA entities from external systems using Port's webhook integration.   
This approach enables seamless integration with your existing tools and workflows for real-time data ingestion.

<h5>Create the webhook</h5>

1. Go to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page.

2. Click `+ Data source` → `Webhook` → `Custom integration`.

3. Fill in the webhook details:
   - **Title**: `RCA Webhook Integration`
   - **Identifier**: Leave auto-generate enabled or set to `rcaWebhook`
   - **Description**: `Automatically create RCA entities from external systems`
   - **Icon**: Select an appropriate icon (e.g., Webhook or Bug)

4. Click `Next` to proceed to the mapping configuration.

**Step 2: Configure the webhook URL**

You'll see your unique webhook URL that external systems will use:
```
https://ingest.getport.io/YOUR_WEBHOOK_KEY
```

**Step 3: Configure the mapping**

In the mapping section, replace the default configuration with:

```json showLineNumbers title="RCA Webhook Mapping"
[
  {
    "blueprint": "rootCauseAnalysis",
    "operation": "create",
    "filter": ".body.event_type == \"post_mortem_created\"",
    "entity": {
      "identifier": ".body.incident_id | tostring",
      "title": ".body.title",
      "properties": {
        "summary": ".body.summary",
        "incidentDate": ".body.incident_date",
        "severity": ".body.severity",
        "affectedServices": ".body.affected_services",
        "tags": ".body.tags",
        "rootCause": ".body.root_cause",
        "resolution": ".body.resolution",
        "preventiveMeasures": ".body.preventive_measures",
        "lessonsLearned": ".body.lessons_learned"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

<h5>Test the mapping</h5>

1. In the "Add test event" section, you can paste a sample JSON payload to test your mapping.

2. Use this test payload:

```json showLineNumbers title="Test webhook payload"
{
  "headers": {},
  "body": {
    "event_type": "post_mortem_created",
    "incident_id": "rca-test-incident-001",
    "title": "Test RCA - Database Connection Pool Exhaustion",

3. Click `Test mapping` to validate that your configuration correctly creates an RCA entity.

4. Once the test passes, click `Save` to create your webhook integration.

<h5>Configure security (optional)</h5>

If you need to secure your webhook, you can configure authentication in the Settings tab:
- **Secret**: Set a shared secret for signature validation
- **Signature Header**: Specify the header containing the signature
- **Algorithm**: Choose the hashing algorithm (sha256 recommended)

<h5> Send data to webhook</h5>

Once your webhook is configured and saved, external systems can send POST requests to your webhook URL to automatically create RCA entities:

```bash showLineNumbers title="Example external system integration"
curl -X POST "https://ingest.getport.io/YOUR_WEBHOOK_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

:::tip Add more RCA entities
For a more comprehensive knowledge base, consider adding 5-10 RCA documents covering different types of incidents your organization has experienced.
:::

## Update AI agent configuration

Now we'll modify the Incident Manager AI agent to include access to our RCA documents.

<h3> Add RCA blueprint to allowed blueprints</h3>

1. Go to the [AI Agents](https://app.getport.io/_ai_agents) page.

2. Find the **Incident Manager** agent and click on the `...` on the far right of the row.

3. Click on `Edit`.

4. In the `allowed_blueprints` array, add `"rootCauseAnalysis"`:

    ```json showLineNumbers
        "allowed_blueprints": [
        "pagerdutyService",
        "pagerdutyIncident", 
        "pagerdutyEscalationPolicy",
        "pagerdutySchedule",
        "pagerdutyOncall",
        "pagerdutyUser",
        "_user",
        "_team",
        "service",
        "rootCauseAnalysis" //highlight
        ]
    ```

5. Click `Save` to save the changes.


<h3> Update the agent prompt</h3>

Enhance the prompt to include instructions about using RCA context:

1. Click on `Edit property` on the `Prompt` field.

2. Replace the existing content with the following:

    <details>
    <summary>Enhanced agent prompt</summary>
    
    ```markdown showLineNumbers"
        You are an agent responsible for answering questions about PagerDuty incidents, services, escalation policies, schedules, and on-call rotations. 
        You also have access to historical Root Cause Analysis (RCA) documents from past incidents.

        ## Guidelines
        - Provide clear information about incidents
        - Identify who is on-call for services (both primary and secondary on-call)  
        - Report on incident statistics and resolution times
        - When relevant, reference past RCA documents to provide context and suggest solutions
        - Use RCA lessons learned to help prevent similar incidents
        - Suggest preventive measures based on historical incident patterns
        ```
    </details>

3. Click `Save` to save the changes.

<h3> Add RCA-focused conversation starters</h3>

1. Click on `Edit property` on the `Conversation starters` field.

2. Replace the existing content with the following:

    <details>
    <summary>Conversation starters</summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
        [
        "Who is on call for the payment service?",
        "What are the active incidents right now?", 
        "What is our average incident resolution time?",
        "Have we seen database connection issues before?",
        "What can we learn from past payment service incidents?",
        "Show me RCAs for incidents similar to the current one"
        ]
   ```
    </details>

3. Click `Save property` to save the changes.

4. Click on `Update` to save the changes to the agent.

:::info Using RCA Context
You can now use these RCA context in your agent's responses:
- Search RCA documents when users ask about similar past incidents.
- Reference specific resolution steps from past incidents when applicable.
- Highlight patterns across multiple incidents.
- Suggest preventive measures from historical data.
:::


## Test the enhanced agent

Let's test that our agent can now reference RCA documents with some example questions.

**Question**: "We're seeing database connection timeouts in the payment service. Have we experienced this before?"

**Expected response**: The agent should reference the RCA document we created and provide details about the previous database connection pool exhaustion incident, including the resolution steps and preventive measures.

<br /><br />

**Question**: "What lessons have we learned from past payment service incidents?"

**Expected response**: The agent should search through RCA documents tagged with payment-related services and summarize key lessons learned.

<img src="/img/ai-agents/AIAgentRCAResponse2.png" border="1" width="100%" />

<br /><br />

**Question**: "How should we prevent memory leaks in our services?"

**Expected response**: The agent should reference preventive measures from relevant RCA documents.

## Conclusion

You have successfully enhanced your AI agent with custom context using entities! Your Incident Manager agent now has access to historical incident knowledge, making it significantly more valuable for both current incident response and prevention of future issues.

The approach we've demonstrated here can be extended to other types of documentation:
- **Runbooks**: Create a "Runbook" blueprint with markdown procedures.
- **Architecture docs**: Store system architecture information.
- **Process documentation**: Include incident response procedures. 
- **Best practices**: Capture organizational standards and guidelines.

## Additional ideas

Beyond incident management, you can use the same approach to enhance your AI agents with various types of organizational knowledge:

<h3> Documentation Agent</h3>

Create a "Documentation" blueprint to store:
- **API documentation**: Store OpenAPI specs, endpoint descriptions, and usage examples.
- **Onboarding guides**: New team member checklists and getting-started resources.
- **Technical standards**: Coding standards, architectural patterns, and best practices.

```json title="Example question"
"Where can I find the API documentation for the user authentication service?"
```

<h3> Deployment Agent</h3>

Create a "Deployment Guide" blueprint to store:
- **Environment-specific configs**: Production, staging, and development deployment procedures.
- **Release notes**: Feature descriptions, breaking changes, and migration guides.
- **Rollback procedures**: Step-by-step recovery instructions for different scenarios.

```json title="Example question"
"What's the rollback procedure for the payment service in production?"
```

<h3> Security Agent</h3>

Create a "Security Policy" blueprint to store:
- **Compliance requirements**: SOC2, GDPR, and other regulatory guidelines.
- **Security reviews**: Vulnerability assessments and remediation procedures.
- **Access control policies**: Permission matrices and approval workflows.

```json title="Example question"
"What are the security requirements for handling customer data?"
```

<h3> Knowledge Base Agent</h3>

Create a "FAQ" or "Knowledge Article" blueprint to store:
- **Common issues**: Frequently asked questions and their solutions.
- **Troubleshooting guides**: Step-by-step diagnostic procedures.
- **Team knowledge**: Tribal knowledge, tips, and tricks from experienced team members.

```json title="Example question"
"How do I debug slow database queries in our application?"
```

:::tip Start small and expand
Begin with one additional use case that addresses your team's most common questions, then gradually expand to cover more areas as you see value from the AI agent interactions.
:::

## Next steps

Here are some ways to expand and improve your setup:

- **Automate RCA creation**: Set up automations to create RCA entities from incident post-mortems.
- **Cross-reference data**: Link RCAs to services, teams, and other relevant entities using relations.
- **Monitor agent usage**: Review AI invocation logs to see how effectively the agent uses RCA context.
- **Add more context types**: Create additional blueprints for different types of organizational knowledge.
- **Regular maintenance**: Periodically review and update RCA documents as processes evolve.
