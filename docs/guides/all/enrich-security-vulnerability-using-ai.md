description: Use Port AI agents with Claude Code to enrich security vulnerabilities and trigger automated fixes
---

# Enrich security vulnerabilities using AI

Security teams often face two critical challenges that slow down vulnerability remediation:

1. **Understanding vulnerabilities quickly** — Raw scanner output is dense, technical, and rarely provides clear remediation steps
2. **Acting fast enough** — Even after analysis, fixing issues typically requires manual developer effort, leading to delays and higher risk exposure

This guide demonstrates how to solve both problems using Port's **AI agents**. When a vulnerability is marked as **critical**, an AI agent automatically enriches it with a clear summary, impact explanation, and actionable remediation steps. Once that summary is available, **Claude Code** is triggered to generate and propose a fix in a pull request — reducing time-to-remediation from days to minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Completed the [onboarding process](/getting-started/overview)
- A Port account with [AI agents feature enabled](/ai-interfaces/ai-agents/overview#access-to-the-feature)
- Security vulnerabilities synced into Port (e.g., via [Snyk](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/code-quality-security/snyk/), [Wiz](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/code-quality-security/wiz), or [SonarQube](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/code-quality-security/sonarqube))
- Completed the setup in the [Trigger Claude Code from Port guide](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/trigger-claude-code-from-port)

:::tip Alternative coding agents
While this guide uses Claude Code as the coding agent, you can easily substitute it with other AI coding assistants like [GitHub Copilot](/guides/all/trigger-github-copilot-from-port) or [Google Gemini](/guides/all/trigger-gemini-assistant-from-port). Simply update the webhook URL and payload structure in the automation to match your preferred coding agent's API.
:::

## Set up data model

First, you need to ensure your vulnerability blueprint includes an `ai_summary` property to store the AI-generated analysis.

1. Go to the [builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal
2. Search for the blueprint you want to update
3. Click on the `{...}` button in the top right corner, and choose `Edit JSON`
4. Add this JSON snippet to the properties of the blueprint:

    ```json
          "ai_summary": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "AI Analysis",
            "description": "AI-generated analysis and remediation steps",
            "format": "markdown"
          }
    ```
5. Click `Save`


## Create a self-service action

Next, you will create a self-service action that updates vulnerability entities with AI-generated summaries. This action will be called by the AI agent to store its analysis.

1. Head to the [self-service](https://app.getport.io/self-serve) page of your portal
2. Click on the `+ New Action` button
3. Click on the `{...} Edit JSON` button
4. Copy and paste the following JSON configuration into the editor

<details>
<summary><b>Update vulnerability with AI summary action (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "update_vulnerability_with_ai_summary",
  "title": "Update Vulnerability with AI Summary",
  "icon": "Vulnerability",
  "description": "Updates the vulnerability entity with AI-generated analysis and remediation steps",
  "trigger": {
    "type": "self-service",
    "operation": "DAY-2",

      "properties": {
        "ai_summary": {
          "type": "string",
          "title": "AI Summary",
          "format": "markdown"
        }
      },
      "required": ["ai_summary"],
      "order": ["ai_summary"]
    },
    "blueprintIdentifier": "securityVulnerability"
  },
  "invocationMethod": {
    "type": "WEBHOOK",
    "url": "https://api.getport.io/v1/blueprints/{{.action.blueprint}}/entities/{{.entity.identifier}}",
    "agent": false,
    "synchronized": true,
    "method": "PATCH",
    "headers": {
      "RUN_ID": "{{ .run.id }}",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "body": {
      "properties": {
        "ai_summary": "{{ .inputs.ai_summary }}"
      }
    }
  },
  "requiredApproval": false
}
```
</details>

:::tip Configuration adjustments
Make sure to adjust the following fields:
- **`blueprintIdentifier`** - Change this to match the blueprint representing security issues in your data model (e.g., `snykVulnerability`, `wizIssue`, `sonarQubeIssue` for Snyk, Wiz, and SonarQube respectively)
:::

5. Click `Save`

## Create your AI agent

Now let's create an AI agent that analyzes vulnerabilities and calls the action above to update them with AI-generated summaries.

1. Go to the [AI Agents](https://app.getport.io/_ai_agents) page of your portal
2. Click on `+ AI Agent`
3. Toggle `Json mode` on
4. Copy and paste the following JSON schema

<details>
<summary><b>Vulnerability enrichment agent (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "identifier": "vulnerability_enrichment_agent",
  "title": "Vulnerability Enrichment Agent",
  "icon": "Vulnerability",
  "properties": {
    "description": "Provides remediation steps and mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities",
    "status": "active",
    "allowed_blueprints": [
      "securityVulnerability",
      "githubRepo"
    ],
    "allowed_actions": [
      "update_vulnerability_with_ai_summary"
    ],
    "prompt": "You are an agent responsible for analyzing security vulnerabilities and providing actionable recommendations.\n\n### Guidelines\n- Summarize the vulnerability in simple terms.\n- Explain the potential impact if exploited.\n- Recommend step-by-step remediation strategies.\n- Suggest best practices to prevent similar vulnerabilities.\n- Tailor responses to the severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).\n\nAfter generating the summary, call the \"update_vulnerability_with_ai_summary\" action to update the vulnerability entity with the summary",
    "execution_mode": "Automatic",
    "conversation_starters": [
      "Explain the impact of CVE-2025-1234",
      "Suggest a remediation plan for this SQL injection vulnerability",
      "What steps should I take to patch a high severity XSS issue?"
    ]
  },
  "relations": {}
}
```
</details>

5. Click `Create` to save the agent

## Set up automations

We will now create two automations that orchestrate the complete vulnerability enrichment and remediation workflow:

1. **Trigger the AI agent** when a vulnerability's severity changes to **Critical**
2. **Assign Claude Code** to generate a fix based on the AI-provided summary and open a pull request

:::tip Multiple approaches
This automation is currently configured to trigger when a vulnerability's severity changes to **Critical**. You can easily adapt the trigger criteria based on your workflow needs:

- Enrich vulnerabilities when severity is **High** or above
- Trigger AI enrichment only for vulnerabilities belonging to specific services or teams
- Run enrichment on newly created vulnerabilities regardless of severity
- Apply different enrichment prompts depending on vulnerability type (e.g., SQL injection vs. misconfiguration)
:::

### Automation 1: Trigger AI agent on severity change

This automation detects when a vulnerability becomes critical and triggers the AI agent to analyze it.

1. Go to the [automations](https://app.getport.io/settings/automations) page of your portal

        "prompt": "Here is the information about the security vulnerability: {{ .event.diff.after }}.\n\nGenerate a code fix for the issue based on the AI-provided summary {{ .event.diff.after.properties.ai_summary }}.\nAfter generating the code, open a PR with a description summarizing what was fixed and why."
      }
    }
  },
  "publish": true
}
```
</details>

## Test your workflow

Now it's time to test your complete vulnerability enrichment workflow:

1. **Create or sync a vulnerability** with severity set to **Critical**
2. **Port automatically triggers** the **Generate AI Security Summary** automation
3. **The AI agent enriches** the vulnerability with a clear summary and remediation steps
4. **The Auto Fix Security Vulnerability** automation triggers Claude Code, which generates a code fix and opens a pull request in your repository
5. **Review and merge** the PR to complete the remediation loop

## What's next?

Your automated security workflow is now complete! Here are some ways you can extend it:

- **Integrate with other coding agents**: Replace Claude Code with [GitHub Copilot](/guides/all/trigger-github-copilot-from-port) or any other coding agent integrated with Port
- **Customize triggers**: Adjust when and how the AI agent is triggered based on your security policies
- **Add approval workflows**: Require human approval before automatically applying fixes
- **Scale to other issue types**: Apply the same pattern to bugs, performance issues, or compliance violations
