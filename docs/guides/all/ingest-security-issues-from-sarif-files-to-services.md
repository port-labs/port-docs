# Ingest security issues from `.sarif` files and relate them to services

This guide will demonstrate how to ingest security issues from `.sarif` files and relate them to the corresponding service entities in Port.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a Port account and have completed the [onboarding process](https://docs.getport.io/quickstart).
- The `Service` blueprint should be created during the onboarding process.
- Ensure you have [GitHub](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/installation.md) or [Gitlab](/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/gitlab/installation) installed and configured in your environment.

## Data model setup


### Add blueprint 
Add the `Security Issue` blueprint:

1. **Go to the [Builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model)** in your Port portal.
2. **Click on "+ Blueprint"**.
3. **Click on the `{...}` button** in the top right corner, and choose "Edit JSON".
4. **Add this JSON schema**:

<details>
<summary><b>Security Issue Blueprint (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
      "identifier": "security_issue",
      "description": "A security issue parsed from SARIF format",
      "title": "Security Issue",
      "icon": "Alert",
      "schema": {
        "properties": {
          "rule_name": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Rule Name"
          },
          "rule_desc": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Rule Description"
          },
          "location": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Location"
          },
          "message": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Message"
          },
          "title": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Title"
          },
          "ai_summary": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "ai_summary",
            "format": "markdown"
          }
        },
        "required": []
      },
      "mirrorProperties": {},
      "calculationProperties": {},
      "aggregationProperties": {},
      "relations": {
        "issue_service": {
          "title": "issue service",
          "description": "The service this issue was found in",
          "target": "service",
          "required": false,
          "many": false
        }
      }
}
```

### Ingest Security Issues from `.sarif` files

To ingest security issues listed in `.sarif` files, follow these steps:

1. **Go to the [data sources page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources)** in your Port portal, and select your GitHub/Gitlab integration.
2. **Modify the mapping** to include the `file` kind with the configuration provided below:

<details>
<summary><b>Port Configuration (Click to expand)</b></summary>

```yaml showLineNumbers
- kind: file
    selector:
      query: 'true'
      files:
        - path: '**/*.sarif'
    port:
      itemsToParse: |
        .file.content.runs[0] as $content |
        $content.tool.driver.rules as $rules |
        [ $content.results[] ] |
        map(
          . as $result |
          {
          ruleId: .ruleId,
          error: .message.text,
          loc: .locations[0].physicalLocation.artifactLocation.uri,
          ruleName: ($rules[] | select(.id == $result.ruleId) | .name),
          ruleDesc: ($rules[] | select(.id == $result.ruleId) | .shortDescription.text)
          })
      entity:
        mappings:
          identifier: .repo.name + "_" + .item.ruleId
          title: .item.error
          blueprint: '"security_issue"'
          properties:
            rule_name: .item.ruleName
            rule_desc: .item.ruleDesc
            location: .item.loc
            message: .item.error
          relations:
            issue_service: .repo.name
```

</details>

### Configuration details

- **`kind: file`** specifies that the source is a file, in this case, `.sarif` files.
- **`files:`** defines the path pattern to locate `.sarif` files within your repositories.
- **`itemsToParse:`** processes the `.sarif` file content to extract security issues.
- **`identifier:`** constructs a unique identifier for each security issue by combining the repository name and the rule ID.
- **`properties:`** captures essential details like rule name, description, location, and message.
- **`relations:`** establishes a relation between the security issue and the corresponding service.


<br/>

<h2> Example </h2>

Once you have configured the data source and mappings, the extracted security issues will appear in the Port UI with properties like rule name, description, location, and message.
Hereâ€™s an example SARIF file structure that you can copy and replicate for testing purposes:

              }
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

:::info File format

The `.sarif` format is a standardized structure for reporting static analysis results. This guide relies on that standard format, but additional fields can be extracted or modified. 
For example:
- The `location` field is an array in SARIF and can be treated as relations to specific components if needed.
- The mapping configuration can be customized to accommodate new properties, making this approach flexible for various use cases.
  :::

By following these steps, you can effectively ingest security issues from `.sarif` files and relate them to the corresponding service entities in Port ðŸŽ‰.
