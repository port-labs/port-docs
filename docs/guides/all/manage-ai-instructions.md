# Manage AI Instructions with Port

In the age of AI coding agents (Claude, Copilot, Gemini, Cursor), teams need a single source of truth for how autonomous agents should contribute to repositories. Traditionally, these rules are stored manually in different locations based on the coding agent's specification - such as `.cursor/rules`, `.github/copilot-instructions`, or other agent-specific folders. However, managing these scattered files at scale is cumbersome and leads to inconsistency.

To deal with this challenge, you can adopt the [`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md) structure as a unified standard for all AI coding instructions, regardless of the specific agent being used, and automate it with Port.

This guide demonstrates how to centralize these instructions inside your internal developer portal, and automatically sync them back into GitHub repositories whenever they are updated. This ensures consistency, visibility, and automation â€” without developers needing to manually edit `AGENTS.md`.

## Common use cases

- **Centralize AI guidelines** by managing all AI agent instructions from a single location in Port
- **Ensure consistency** across repositories by automatically syncing updated instructions via pull requests
- **Reduce manual overhead** by eliminating the need for developers to manually update `AGENTS.md` files

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes the following:
- You have a Port account and have completed the [onboarding process](https://docs.port.io/getting-started/overview).
- [GitHub integration](https://docs.port.io/build-your-software-catalog/sync-data-to-catalog/git/github/) is installed in your account.
- You have access to [create and configure AI agents](https://docs.port.io/ai-interfaces/ai-agents/overview#access-to-the-feature) in Port.
- You have completed the setup in one of the following trigger coding agents guides:
  - [Trigger Claude Code from Port](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/trigger-claude-code-from-port) - for Claude Code integration
  - [Trigger GitHub Copilot from Port](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/trigger-github-copilot-from-port) - for GitHub Copilot integration
  - [Trigger Gemini Assistant from Port](https://docs.port.io/guides/all/trigger-gemini-assistant-from-port) - for Google Gemini integration


## Set up data model

We will enhance the GitHub repository blueprint to include AI instructions and configure the GitHub integration to sync these instructions automatically.

### Update the repository blueprint

To track AI instructions, we need to add a property for managing AI agent contribution guidelines.

1. Go to the [builder](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) page of your portal.
2. Find and select your existing repository blueprint (e.g., `githubRepository`).
3. Click on `{...} Edit JSON`.
4. Add the following property to the `properties` section:

    <details>
    <summary><b>AI instructions property (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
    "ai_instructions": {
      "title": "AI Instructions",
      "description": "Rules and contribution guidelines for AI coding agents",
      "type": "string",
      "format": "markdown"
    }
    ```
    </details>

5. Click `Save` to update the blueprint.


### Update GitHub integration mapping

Now we need to configure the GitHub integration to automatically sync the AI instructions between Port and GitHub repositories.

1. Go to the [data sources](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-sources) page of your portal.
2. Find your GitHub integration and click on it.
3. Go to the `Mapping` tab.
4. Update the mapping configuration to include the AI instructions property:

    <details>
    <summary><b>GitHub integration mapping configuration (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```yaml showLineNumbers
    deleteDependentEntities: false
    createMissingRelatedEntities: true
    enableMergeEntity: true
    resources:
      - kind: repository
        selector:
          query: true
        port:
          entity:
            mappings:
              identifier: .full_name
              title: .name
              blueprint: '"service"'
              properties:
                readme: file://README.md
                ai_instructions: file://AGENTS.md
                url: .html_url
                defaultBranch: .default_branch
    ```
    </details>

5. Click `Save` to update the integration configuration.

:::caution File path considerations
The integration will look for the `AGENTS.md` file at the root of each repository. Ensure your repositories follow this standardized file structure for consistent mapping across your organization.
:::

## Centralizing AI instructions

The AGENTS.md pattern involves creating a centralized `AGENTS.md` file at the root of your repository that serves as the single source of truth for all AI coding instructions. To make your AI coding agents reference this standardized file, you need to configure them to point to it:

<Tabs groupId="agent-config" queryString>
<TabItem value="cursor" label="Cursor" default>

Create a `.cursor/rules` file in your repository with the following configuration:

```yaml showLineNumbers
---
description: General Guidelines
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---

@AGENTS.md
```

This configuration tells Cursor to always apply the guidelines from the `AGENTS.md` file to all files in your repository.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="copilot" label="GitHub Copilot">

In your repository settings or create a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file with:

```markdown showLineNumbers
Reference the `AGENTS.md` file for all coding guidelines and instructions.
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="claude" label="Claude Code">


For Claude Code, you can reference the `AGENTS.md` file in your `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown showLineNumbers
Please follow the coding guidelines and instructions specified in the `AGENTS.md` file at the root of this repository.
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="other" label="Other AI Agents">

For other AI coding agents, configure them to reference the `AGENTS.md` file in their respective configuration files:

- **Gemini CLI**: Add reference in your `GEMINI.md` custom instructions file 
- **Custom agents**: Include instructions to read and follow the `AGENTS.md` file

The key is to ensure all agents point to the same centralized source of truth.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure AI agent

Before setting up the automation, we need to create an AI agent that will handle the actual file updates in GitHub repositories. Choose the configuration that matches your preferred AI coding agent:

## Set up automation

When `ai_instructions` changes in Port, you want those updates to be reflected in GitHub. For this, configure an **automation** that triggers whenever the property changes, and forwards the updated Markdown to the AI agent that manages `AGENTS.md`.

1. Go to the [Automations](https://app.getport.io/settings/automations) page of your portal.
2. Click on `+ Automation`.
3. Copy and paste the following JSON configuration:

    <details>
    <summary><b>Update AI Instructions automation (click to expand)</b></summary>

    ```json showLineNumbers
    {
      "identifier": "update_ai_instructions",
      "title": "Update AI Instructions",
      "description": "Automation to trigger the AI agent when the AI instructions changes",
      "icon": "AI",
      "trigger": {
        "type": "automation",
