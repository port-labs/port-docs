# Launch

*This section will explain how to introduce your developer portal to your organization, and how to make it intuitive and easy to use for your users.*

*It will answer questions like:*

- *How do I make sure my org members can easily navigate the software catalog? i.e. use folders in the catalog*
- *How do I communicate the available self-service actions to my developers? i.e. a detailed homepage with a readme*
- *How do I make sure each persona in my organization sees the relevant data? i.e. use customized dashboards*
