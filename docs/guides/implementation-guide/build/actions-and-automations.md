# Create actions and automations

Now that you have set up your software catalog, it's time to create self-service actions and automations to use the data you've ingested to automate common tasks and trigger actions based on events. 

## Set up self-service actions

Self-service actions are a great way to enable users to perform routine tasks in a safe, repeatable, and auditable way.  

Create [self-service actions](/actions-and-automations/create-self-service-experiences/) for common tasks that users can perform on their own, for example:
- Scaffolding a new service.
- Requesting a cloud resource.
- Reporting an incident.

## Set up automations

Automations are used to trigger actions based on events in your portal.  
They can be used to automate routine tasks, trigger alerts, create/delete resources, and much more.

Create [automations](/actions-and-automations/define-automations/) to automate tasks based on events in your portal.  
For example:
  - Send notifications to relevant users when a new service is created/updated.
  - Trigger an incident when a service degrades.

## Next step - launch

Now that the significant components in your portal have been created, you are ready to launch your portal.  

Before announcing the launch, there are several steps we recommend you take to ensure a successful and effective launch, proceed to the [Launch phase](/guides/implementation-guide/launch/) for more information.
