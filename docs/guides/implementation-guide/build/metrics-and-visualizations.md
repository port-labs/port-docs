# Set up metrics & visualizations



### Define scorecards

Define metrics and standards you wish to track for the blueprints in your portal.  
Some examples include:

- **Production readiness**: define and measure criteria for a service to be considered production-ready.
- **API health**: track the availability, performance, and usage of your APIs.
- **Service health**: define what constitutes a healthy service and track its status.
- **Incidents**: Track the number of incidents, their severity, and resolution times.

[Create scorecards](/promote-scorecards/) for the relevant blueprints in your portal.

### Create dashboards

Dashboards are a great way to visualize and track data from your software catalog.  
A dashboard can contain any number of widgets that display data relevant to your users.

We recommend creating dashboards for different personas in your organization to display data that is important to them.  
Some examples include:
  - A dashboard for **developers** to track the health of their team's services.
  - A dashboard for **developers** that displays their open pull requests and issues.
  - A dashboard for **R&D managers** to track the performance of APIs and services.
  - A dashboard for **security teams** to track access control and security policies.

Dashboards can be created/modified in 3 locations:
  - Your portal's homepage.
  - In a dashboard page in your software catalog.
  - In a specific entity page.

See the [available widgets](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/) you can create in any dashboard.

:::tip Static & dynamic filters
When creating certain widgets, you can define [**static filters**](/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/#chart-filters) to exclude specific data.

You can also define [**dynamic filters**](/search-and-query/#dynamic-properties) to display data relevant to the logged-in user.
