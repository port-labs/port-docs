# Launch

Now that you have completed setting up the components to implement your MVP, you are ready for the exciting part - launching the portal to your users ðŸš€

When launching, it's important to ensure that your portal is user-friendly, easy to navigate, and provides clear value to your users.

This page will help you prepare for a successful launch by organizing your portal and creating components that will allow your users to easily find the information they need.

### Create a detailed homepage

- Add a detailed homepage to your portal with a [readme](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/#markdown) that explains the purpose of the portal, the available self-service actions, and how to use them.
- Use the homepage to communicate announcements, updates, initiatives, and other important information to your users.
  This can also be done using a [markdown widget](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/#markdown).
- Create useful visualizations that display data [relevant for the logged-in user](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/#dynamic-filters).
- Create a quick-access widget for links to useful pages, like the one in Port's [live demo](https://demo.getport.io):

### Organize the software catalog

- Use [folders](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/folders) in the software catalog to organize resources by persona, team, or any other relevant criteria.
- Create additional [catalog/dashboard pages](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/dashboards/#dynamic-filters) for different personas in your organization.
- [Show/hide columns](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/catalog-page#hideshow-columns) in catalog pages to reduce visual clutter and make it easier for users to focus on the information they need.
- Organize [specific entity pages](https://docs.getport.io/customize-pages-dashboards-and-plugins/page/entity-page):
  - Show/hide properties.
  - Show/hide related entities.
  - Create dashboards for specific entities.

### Enable user feedback

Create feedback components in your portal:
  - A **self-service action** to report issues and request features.  
    An implementation of this action can be found in Port's [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/self-serve?action=leave_a_feedback_the_portal).

  - A **dashboard** for the platform engineering team to track and handle feedback.  
    An example of such a dashboard can be found in Port's [live demo](https://demo.getport.io/feedback_dashboard).

### Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates

- Create a process for updating the portal with new integrations, blueprints, and features.
- Set up automations to notify users about new features, updates, and changes to the portal.
