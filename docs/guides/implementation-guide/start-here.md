# Implementation guide

This guide provides a structured approach to designing and implementing Port in your organization. It will help you understand the steps involved in setting up Port, integrating it with your existing tools, and preparing it for your organization's use.


Before proceeding to the guide, there a few initial steps to complete:

1. [Sign up to Port](http://app.getport.io) to create an initial developer portal for your organization.

2. Complete Port's quick [onboarding process](/getting-started/overview) to ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to get started.

3. Join the [Port community Slack channel](https://www.getport.io/community) to connect with other Port users and ask for support. 


Once you're ready, proceed to [Plan](/guides/implementation-guide/plan/define-portal) part of the implementation guide to begin your implementation process.
