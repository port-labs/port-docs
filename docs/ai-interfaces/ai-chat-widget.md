# AI Chat Widget

The AI Chat Widget provides a customizable interface for interacting with [Port AI](/ai-interfaces/port-ai/overview) directly within your dashboards. Platform engineers can configure the widget's prompts, conversation starters, and available tools to create tailored AI chat experiences for developers.

## What is the AI Chat Widget?

The AI Chat Widget is a dashboard component that:

- **Provides chat interface**: Renders an interactive chat experience for Port AI
- **Displays conversation starters**: Shows predefined prompts to help users get started
- **Uses configured tools**: Operates with the specific Port AI tools you select
- **Customizable placement**: Can be embedded in any dashboard layout
- **Respects permissions**: Only accesses data based on user permissions

## Widget Configuration

When setting up an AI Chat Widget, you can customize three key aspects:

### Custom Prompts
Configure the system prompt that guides how Port AI responds within the widget. This allows you to:
- Set the tone and style of responses
- Focus on specific domain knowledge 
- Provide context about your organization or use case
- Guide the AI's behavior for your specific audience

### Conversation Starters
Define predefined prompts that appear as clickable options when users first interact with the widget. Examples include:
- "Show me services failing security checks"
- "What's the status of my team's deployments?"
- "Help me understand our incident response process"
- "Find microservices with high bug counts"

### Tool Selection
Choose which Port AI tools the widget can access, allowing you to:
- Limit functionality to specific use cases
- Control what data the widget can query
- Ensure appropriate permissions and access levels
- Focus the AI's capabilities on relevant areas

## Setting Up the Widget

Follow these steps to add an AI Chat Widget to your dashboard:

1. Navigate to the dashboard where you want to add the widget
2. Click on `+ Widget`
3. Select `AI Chat` from the widget options
4. Configure your widget settings:
   - **Custom Prompt**: Set the system prompt for AI behavior
   - **Conversation Starters**: Add predefined prompts for users
   - **Tools**: Select which Port AI tools to enable
   - **Title**: Set a descriptive name for the widget
5. Position the widget in your dashboard grid
6. Save your dashboard configuration
7. Start asking questions through the chat interface

## Using the Widget

Once configured, the AI Chat Widget provides an intuitive interface:

### Conversation Starters
When users first interact with the widget, they'll see the conversation starters you configured. These appear as clickable buttons that immediately send the predefined prompt to Port AI.

### Chat Interface  
Users can type their own questions and requests directly into the chat interface. The widget will:
- Process requests using the configured prompt and tools
- Display responses in a conversational format
- Show visual indicators when tools are being used
- Provide links to relevant Port pages and actions

### Tool Transparency
The widget interface provides enhanced capabilities and visual indicators showing which tools are being used:

This transparency helps users understand how Port AI is processing their requests and which data sources are being accessed.
