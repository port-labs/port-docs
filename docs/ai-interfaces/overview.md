# AI Interfaces Overview

Port's AI interfaces provide intelligent assistance across your entire software development lifecycle. Our AI capabilities are currently in **open beta**, with Slack App in **closed beta**.

We're committed to developing AI responsibly, maintaining high standards of data privacy and security. **[Learn more about our security & data controls →](/ai-interfaces/port-ai/security-and-data-controls)**

## What makes Port's AI different

Port's AI interfaces are powered by its [Context Lake](/ai-interfaces/context-lake) - your unified engineering knowledge layer that connects data from across your entire toolchain. Port's AI understands YOUR organization: your service ownership, deployment patterns, team structures, quality standards, and operational context.

This organizational intelligence enables AI to provide accurate answers about who owns what, make decisions within your governance guardrails, and take actions that align with your engineering standards.

### MCP Server

:::info Open Beta
Port MCP Server is currently in open beta and available for wide usage.
:::

Seamless connection to your IDE and AI agents, allowing builders to build Port in natural language and developers/AI agents to ask questions and run actions directly from their development environment.

**Use MCP Server to:**
* Ask questions about your catalog from within your IDE, like getting the API specs required for a task
* Run Port actions without leaving your code editor, like creating a new dev env for testing your feature
* Build and modify Port configurations using natural language, like creating a production readiness scorecard
* Access Port's API and tools through familiar development interfaces

The MCP Server provides AI machine interface capabilities that are compatible with AI Agents and integrates directly with your development workflow.
