# Relation operators

This page details the available relation operators when writing [rules](/search-and-query/#rules) as part of the search route.

## RelatedTo

The `relatedTo` operator will return all entities that have a relationship with the specified entity:

### Structure

| Field       | Description                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `operator`  | Search operator to use when evaluating this rule, see a list of available operators below. |
| `blueprint` | Blueprint of the entity identifier specified in the `value` field.                         |
| `value`     | Value to filter by.                                                                        |


```json showLineNumbers
{
  "operator": "relatedTo",
  "blueprint": "myBlueprint",
  "value": "myEntity"
}
```

The operator also supports multiple related entities as the searched value:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "operator": "relatedTo",
  "blueprint": "myBlueprint",
  "value": ["myFirstEntity", "mySecondEntity"]
}
```
This query will return all of the entities that are related to one or more of the identifiers in the value array.

### Required

The `relatedTo` operator also supports the `required` property - which allows you to search for:

- Related entities from all relations (relations with either required `true` or `false`).
- Related entities only from required relations (relations with required `true`).
- Related entities only from non-required relations (relations with required `false`).

For example, to search only for related entities that _require_ the `myEntity` entity from the `myBlueprint` blueprint, use the following search rule:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "operator": "relatedTo",
  "required": true,
  "value": "myEntity",
  "blueprint": "myBlueprint"
}
```

### Direction

The `relatedTo` operator also supports the `direction` property - which allows you to search for dependent entities in a specific direction on the dependency graph. To better understand the functionality of this property, let's take a look at the example below:

Let's assume that we have the blueprints `deploymentConfig` and `microservice` with the following relation definition (declared on the `deploymentConfig` blueprint):

```json showLineNumbers
"relations": {
  "microservice": {
    "description": "The service this Deployment Config belongs to",
    "many": false,
    "required": false,
    "target": "microservice",
    "title": "Microservice"
  }
}
```

In addition, we have the following entities:

```text showLineNumbers
Deployment Configs:
- Order-Service-Production
- Cart-Service-Production

Microservices:
- Order Service
- Cart Service

Environments:
- Production
```

And the following relations:

```text showLineNumbers
Order-Service-Production -> Order-Service
Order-Service-Production -> Production

Cart-Service-Production -> Cart-Service
Cart-Service-Production -> Production
```

By looking at the resulting graph layout, we can also map the directions:

![Dependency graph upstream downstream diagram](/img/software-catalog/search-in-port/search-direction-diagram.png)

- To search for entities which the source depends on - use `"direction": "upstream"`.
- To search for entities which depend on the source - use `"direction": "downstream"`.

In the example shown above, if we want to get the `Microservice` and `Environment` that _Order-Service-Production_ depends on, the search rule would be:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "operator": "relatedTo",
  "blueprint": "deploymentConfig",
  "value": "Order-Service-Production",
  "direction": "upstream"
}
```

And the result shall be:

<summary><b>Order-Service-Production upstream related entities (click to expand)</b></summary>

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "ok": true,
  "matchingBlueprints": ["microservice", "environment"],
  "entities": [
    {
      "identifier": "Order-Service",
      "title": "Order-Service",

      "updatedBy": "auth0|62ab380295b34240aa511cdb"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "Production",
      "title": "Production",
      "blueprint": "environment",
      "properties": {
        "awsRegion": "eu-west-1",

        "namespace": "Production"
      },

      "updatedBy": "auth0|62ab380295b34240aa511cdb"
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

If we want to get all of the `deploymentConfigs` that are deployed in the _Production_ `Environment`, the search rule would be:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "operator": "relatedTo",
  "blueprint": "environment",
  "value": "Production",
  "direction": "downstream"
}
```

And the result shall be:

<details>
<summary><b>Production downstream related entities (click to expand)</b></summary>

```json showLineNumbers

  "ok": true,
  "matchingBlueprints": ["deploymentConfig"],

## MatchAny

The `matchAny` operator will match entities based on your input:
- If you specify a single value, it will find all entities with the same identifier.
- If you provide a list of values, it will match any entity whose identifier is in the list.

### Related to by specific path

You can search for entities that are related through a specific path of relations. This is useful when you want to find entities that are connected through a specific chain of relationships.


### Structure

| Field                     | Description                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `property.path`           | An array containing the full path of relation identifiers to traverse.                                               |
| `property.fromBlueprint`  | *(Optional)* The blueprint to start the path traversal from. If omitted, traversal starts from the target blueprint. |
| `operator`                | The search operator to use. For this feature, use `"matchAny"`.                                                      |
| `value`                   | The value or list of values to match against the target entity identifiers at the end of the path.                   |


#### For upstream paths

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "property": {
    "path": ["relation1", "relation2", "relation3"]
  },
  "operator": "matchAny",
  "value": "targetEntity"
}
```

#### For downstream paths

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "property": {
    "path": ["relation1", "relation2", "relation3"],
    "fromBlueprint": "sourceBlueprint"
  },
  "operator": "matchAny",
  "value": "targetEntity"
}
```

When using downstream paths, the `fromBlueprint` parameter specifies the source blueprint from which to start the path traversal. 

Instead of thinking about the path as downstream from the target, we treat it as upstream from the specified blueprint to the target blueprint. This means that the path will be traversed starting from entities of the specified `fromBlueprint`.

### Examples

Suppose you have the following data model:

![Dependency graph upstream downstream diagram](/img/software-catalog/search-in-port/specific-path-diagram-example.png)

<h4> Example 1: Find all services related to a cluster (upstream) </h4>

To find all services that are related to a specific cluster (e.g., "production-cluster"):

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "combinator": "and",
  "rules": [
    {
      "property": "$blueprint",
      "operator": "=",
      "value": "service"
    },
    {
      "property": {
        "path": ["deployedOn"]
      },
      "operator": "matchAny",
      "value": "production-cluster"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will return all **services** that have a deployment in the "production-cluster".

---

<h4> Example 2: Find all deployments related to a specific service (downstream) </h4>

To find all deployments related to a specific service (e.g., "production-service"):

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "combinator": "and",
  "rules": [
    {
      "property": "$blueprint",
      "operator": "=",
      "value": "deployment"
    },
    {
      "property": {
        "path": ["deployedOn", "deployments"],
        "fromBlueprint": "service"
      },
      "operator": "matchAny",
      "value": "production-service"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will return all **deployments** that are related to the "production-service".

---

## Self-relation

Self-relations allow a blueprint to reference itself, so entities of the same type can be connected.

<img src="/img/guides/hierarchyTiers/hierarchyTiers.png" border="1px" width="50%" />  
<br/><br/>  

In this example, a **group** is comprised of one or more **domains**, which are comprised of one or more **tribes**, and so on.  
The diagram illustrates the hierarchy, where different entities are linked by the same self-relation (parent) within the `Team` blueprint.  

You can use the `matchAny` operator to search through self-relations, allowing you to find entities at various levels of the hierarchy.

### Examples

**Example 1: basic self-relation with fixed hops count**

If you want **exactly 2 hops**, specify the self-relation twice:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "combinator": "and",
  "rules": [
    {
      "property": {
        "path": [
          "parent",
          "parent"
        ],
        "fromBlueprint" : "Team"
      },
      "operator": "matchAny",
      "value": "targetEntity"
    }
  ]
}
```
 
For example, if the `value` is `Squad`:
- First hop: `Squad` → `Tribe`.
- Second hop: `Tribe` → `Domain`.

Result: `Domain` (only the final destination after exactly 2 hops).

___

**Example 2: self-relation with maxHops for variable hops**

If you want a variable number of hops (between 1 and 15), use `maxHops`.  
`maxHops` specifies the maximum number of hops to traverse through the self-relation.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "combinator": "and",
  "rules": [
    {
      "property": {
        "path": [
          {
            "relation": "parent",
            "maxHops": 3
          }
        ],
        "fromBlueprint": "Team"
      },
      "operator": "matchAny",
      "value": "targetEntity"
    }
  ]
}
```

For example, if the `value` is `Squad`:
- First hop: `Squad` → `Tribe`.
- Second hop: `Tribe` → `Domain`.
- Third hop: `Domain` → `Group`.

Result: `Tribe`, `Domain` and `Group` (all entities found along the path up to 3 hops).

:::info maxHops limitation
The `maxHops` parameter can only be applied **once** per path, and it accepts values from **1 to 15**.
:::

___

**Example 3: mixed approach**

You can also mix fixed hops with variable hops. For example, if you specify the self-relation twice followed by a `maxHops` object, the system will start traversing from the 2 hops already made and continue with the additional hops specified in `maxHops`.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "combinator": "and",
  "rules": [
    {
      "property": {
        "path": [
          "parent",
          "parent",
          {
            "relation": "parent",
            "maxHops": 3
          }
          ],
          "fromBlueprint": "Team"
        },
      "operator": "matchAny",
      "value": "targetEntity"  
    }
  ]
}
```

For example, if the `value` is `Squad`:
- First hop: `Squad` → `Tribe`.
- Second hop: `Tribe` → `Domain`.
- Third hop: `Domain` → `Group`.

Result: `Domain` (from fixed hops) and `Group` (from variable hops, up to 3 additional hops).
