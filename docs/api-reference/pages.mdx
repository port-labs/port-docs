# Pages

Port API's `pages` endpoints will undergo a structural change in the near future. The new structure will be more intuitive and easier to use.

Until the new structure is released, you can refer to the [Swagger API documentation](https://api.getport.io/swagger/#Pages) for the available endpoints and their usage.

Currently, the `pages` endpoints allow you to:

- **Create**, **update**, **delete**, and **get** pages.
- **Create**, **update**, and **delete** widgets.
- **Update** and **get** page permissions.

:::danger pages api beta status
The Pages API is currently in beta, in its current form it lacks certain validations and protections and it could render your portal unusable if used incorrectly.

If you choose to use the Pages API please understand this risk.

In case you use the Pages API and encounter issues, please reach out to `support@getport.io` for assistance.
