# Pages

Port API's `pages` endpoints will undergo a structural change in the near future. The new structure will be more intuitive and easier to use.

:::danger pages api beta status
The Pages API is currently in beta, in its current form it lacks certain validations and protections and it could render your portal unusable if used incorrectly.

If you choose to use the Pages API please understand this risk.

In case you use the Pages API and encounter issues, please reach out at [support.port.io](http://support.port.io/) for assistance.
:::

Port is rolling out improvements to make the Pages API more **reliable, secure, and intuitive**.  
From mid-September 2025 through mid-November 2025, several modifications will be introduced. These updates will impact both **direct use of the Pages API** and **usage through Terraform**, which until now lacked certain restrictions.  

The table below outlines the upcoming changes, example implications, and current progress status.  
The Status will be updated as work moves forward, from `Not Started` → `WIP` → `Released`.

| Change  | Example Implication  | Status    |
|---------|----------------------|:---------:|
| Add validations, restrictions, and clearer error messages for the widgets schema. | If extra or invalid properties are sent, you will receive a descriptive error showing which one. You should delete the properties and match the current schema. | `WIP`  |
| Add validations, restrictions, and clearer error messages for the pages schema.| For example, the API will block creating two home pages and require you to keep only one. | `Not started`  |
| Enforce a dashboard widget wrapper when creating a new dashboard page.| If you try to create a dashboard page without wrapping the widget, the API (or Terraform) will return an error requiring you to add the wrapper in the JSON. | `Not started`  |

Until the new structure is released, you can refer to the [Swagger API documentation](https://api.port.io/swagger/#Pages) for the available endpoints and their usage.

Currently, the `pages` endpoints allow you to:

- **Create**, **update**, **delete**, and **get** pages.
- **Create**, **update**, and **delete** widgets.
- **Update** and **get** page permissions.
