# Pages

Port API's `pages` endpoints will undergo a structural change in the near future. The new structure will be more intuitive and easier to use.

Until the new structure is released, you can refer to the [Swagger API documentation](https://api.getport.io/swagger/#Pages) for the available endpoints and their usage.

Currently, the `pages` endpoints allow you to:

- **Create**, **update**, **delete**, and **get** pages.
- **Create**, **update**, and **delete** widgets.
- **Update** and **get** page permissions.
