# Rate limits

:::warning Updated API rate limits
Rate limits will be updated on **June 6, 2025**.
Rate limits will change from the **IP level** to the **Organization level**.

<details>
<summary>**Updated rate limits (Click to expand)**</summary>

Updated limits:
| Description | Rate limit   |
|-------------|--------------|
| Unauthenticated requests | 100 requests per 5 minutes |
| Entities API requests    | 35,000 requests per 5 minutes |
| All other API requests   | 15,000 requests per 5 minutes |
## Check the rate limit status
Each API response includes headers that provide information about your current rate limit status:
| Header name | Description  |
|-------------|--------------|
| `x-ratelimit-period`         | The time in seconds which defines the rate limit window |
| `x-ratelimit-limit`          | The maximum number of requests that you can make in during the rate limit window |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining`      | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window |
| `x-ratelimit-reset`          | The time at which the current rate limit window resets, in UTC epoch seconds |
</details>
For the current rate limits, read on below.
:::

Rate limits restrict the number of requests or actions allowed within a certain timeframe to prevent overuse or abuse.
Port enforces multiple rate limits to control extensive usage of Port's API.

Port's rate limits vary based on the API being accessed and may be more lenient for some APIs.  
Rate limits are enforced at the **IP level**.


## Rate limits table

| Description | Rate limit |
|------------|-------------|
| Unauthenticated requests | 100 requests per 5 minutes |
| Ocean integrations | 20,000 requests per 5 minutes |
| External exporters | 15,000 requests per 5 minutes |
| IaC integrations and CI/CD actions | 5,000 requests per 5 minutes |
| Entity API requests | 5,000 requests per 5 minutes | 
| All other API requests | 2,500 requests per 5 minutes |


## How to prevent getting rate limited

{/* 
TODO: uncomment when rate limit changes go into effect

### Monitor rate limit headers

To prevent hitting rate limits, you should monitor the rate limit headers in your API responses.

The `x-ratelimit-remaining` header shows how many requests you have left in the current window.
When this number gets low, you should reduce your request frequency or implement a backoff strategy.

The `x-ratelimit-reset` header tells you when the rate limit window will reset, which can help you plan when to resume normal request rates. */}

### Use exponential backoff

Exponential backoff is a technique used to prevent overwhelming a server with too many requests in a short period of time. It involves progressively increasing the delay between retries when encountering rate limits or server errors.

To implement exponential backoff, you can follow these steps:

1. *Define a base delay*: Start with a small delay, such as 1 second, as the base delay for the first retry.
2. *Define a maximum number of retries*: Determine the maximum number of retries you want to attempt before giving up.
3. *Implement retry logic*: Wrap your API request code in a retry loop that will retry the request if it encounters a rate limit or server error.
4. *Calculate the delay*: Use an exponential function to calculate the delay for each retry. The delay can be calculated using the formula: `delay` = `baseDelay` * (2 ^ `retryCount`), where `retryCount` starts from 0 for the first retry.
5. *Apply the delay*: Before each retry, pause the execution of the code for the calculated delay duration.

Here's are examples of how you can implement exponential backoff:

<Tabs groupId="code-examples" defaultValue="python" values={[
{label: "Python", value: "python"},
{label: "Javascript", value: "javascript"},
]}>

<TabItem value="python">

```python showLineNumbers
import time

base_delay = 1  # 1 second
max_retries = 5
max_delay = 32

def make_api_request():
    # Your API request code goes here
    pass

def retry_with_exponential_backoff():
    attempt = 0
    delay = base_delay
    
    while attempt < max_retries:
        try:
            result = make_api_request()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            attempt += 1
            if attempt >= max_retries:
                raise e
            sleep_time = min(delay * (2 ** attempt), max_delay)
            print(f"Attempt {attempt} failed. Retrying in {sleep_time:.2f} seconds...")
            time.sleep(sleep_time)
    raise Exception("All retry attempts failed.")

retry_with_exponential_backoff()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="javascript">

```javascript showLineNumbers
const baseDelay = 1000; // 1 second
const maxRetries = 5;
let retryCount = 0;

function makeApiRequest() {
  // Your API request code goes here
}

function retryWithExponentialBackoff() {
  if (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, retryCount);
    setTimeout(() => {
      retryCount++;
      makeApiRequest();
    }, delay);
  } else {
    console.log('Exceeded maximum retries');
  }
}

retryWithExponentialBackoff();
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, the `makeApiRequest` function represents your actual API request code. The `retryWithExponentialBackoff` function is responsible for calculating the delay and retrying the request using exponential backoff. It uses the `setTimeout` function to pause the execution for the calculated delay duration. Remember to adjust the `baseDelay` and `maxRetries` values according to your specific requirements. 

Exponential backoff helps to distribute the load on the server and increases the chances of a successful request without exceeding rate limits.
