## Introduction

This API is documented in the **OpenAPI format** and provides programmatic access to Port and its components.  

The API describes the various routes available for use, and can be used directly from the browser by using the `Send API Request` button on the right side of each route's page.

Port is API-first, meaning that this API allows you to achieve any and all of its functionalities.  
You can *read from* and *write to* your software catalog, execute & interact with your self-service actions, fetch & update your scorecards, and much more.

## Authentication

To use the API, you need to obtain an API token from your Port application:

1. Go to your [Port application](https://app.port.io), click on the `...` button in the top right corner, and select `Credentials`.
2. Click on the `Generate API token` button, and copy the generated token.

    An API token is valid for **3 hours**, after which you will need to generate a new one.

## Size limit

The body of all requests is limited to 1 MiB.

## Using the API from the browser

Each route in the API documentation has a `Request` panel on the right side. 

1. In the `bearer` field, paste the API token you obtained from your Port application.
2. Under `Parameters`, fill in your desired values.
3. Under `Body`, you can edit the request body freely and change the parameter values as you wish.

Once you're ready, click the `Send API Request` button to execute the request, the response will be displayed below.  

Alternatively, you can use the panel in the top right to copy a snippet in your desired language to use in your application. Note that these snippets will be updated with the values you filled in the `Request` panel.

### Regions

Port's API is available in two regions:
- Europe: `https://api.port.io`
- United States: `https://api.us.port.io`

When using the API from the browser, you can switch between regions using the dropdown in the `Try it out` panel, by hovering over the `Base URL` field and clicking on `Edit`:

## Troubleshooting

Every response returned from the API contains a special debugging header named `X-Trace-Id` which contains an internal trace ID that can be used by Port's support team to troubleshoot issues with any API request.

For example: `X-Trace-Id: 1e148db358300d10f344b6d54edd4807`

In case you encounter an issue with an API request, either performed directly or captured as part of a browsing session in Port's UI, you can send the `X-Trace-Id` header value along with your support request.
