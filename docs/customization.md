# Portal customization

Port offers various customization options to help you tailor the developer portal to your organization's branding and style.

## Change organization name & logo

The title and logo of the portal (in the top left corner) are set to "Port" by default.  

To change them:

1. Go to the [Builder page](https://app.getport.io/settings/data-model) of your portal.

2. Click on `Organization settings` in the sidebar.

3. Change the `Title` and `Logo URL` to your desired values.  
   The previews will update automatically with your changes, one for light mode and one for dark mode.

4. Click on `Save`.

### Limitations

- The title is limited to 30 characters.
- The logo URL must be a valid public link (e.g. `https://example.com/logo.png`).

## Dark mode

To change the theme of the portal to dark mode:

1. Click on the user button in the top right corner of the portal.

2. Click on `Theme` to toggle between light and dark mode.
