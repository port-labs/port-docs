# Scorecard

## What is a Scorecard?

**Scorecards** enable us to create a set of rules that will determine the level of our Port Entities, based on their properties.
Each scorecard has a set of rules that affects its total level, a rule has a `level` property which is one of the following: `Gold`, `Silver` or `Bronze`. Each rule has specific conditions, and the scorecard level increases when they pass.

**For example**, to keep track of your organization's `Services` maturity, we can create a set of scorecards on top of a `Service` [Blueprint](../blueprint/blueprint.md) that will keep track of their progress. here are some scorecards that we can set:

- Ownership
  - Has a defined on-call?
  - Has a team?
- Security
  - Does it's Snyk vulnerabilities < 1
- Production Readiness
  - Using a Monitoring service?
- Development Quality
  - Have a linter configured?
  - Have tests?

In the end, within the specific Entity profile, we will get a tab per scorecard that shows the rules' progress and status.

## Scorecard total level calculation

A Scorecard is built from several rules, and each one of them has a `level` property.

The available `Scorecard` levels are

`Basic` -> `Bronze` -> `Silver` -> `Gold`

Once an Entity passes all of the rules for a certain level, it level changes accordingly.

:::note
You can't define a rule with a `Basic` level, the `Basic` level this level represents if an Entity hasn't passed the rules determining a `Bronze` level, it will be a `Basic` Tier.

## Scorecard example

Please see the following example of an ownership scorecard.

It has two rules:

1. Check that a defined on-call exists and that the number of `open_incidents` is lower than 5
2. Check if a team exists.

```json showLineNumbers
[
  {

        "identifier": "has_on_call",
        "level": "Gold",

              "value": 5
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "title": "Has a team?",
        "identifier": "has_team",
        "level": "Silver",
        "query": {

              "property": "$team"
            }
          ]
        }
