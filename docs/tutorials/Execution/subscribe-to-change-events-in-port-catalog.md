# Tutorial: Subscribe to Change events in Port Catalog


## Overview

**What‚Äôs New?** üöÄ

You will be able to subscribe to change events in Port, i.e. Change property values, Creation, Deletion, etc.

**How it works** ‚öôÔ∏è

Based on the Audit Log, we publish all of the events to a dedicated Kafka Topic for your organization.

# Working with Kafka

## Concept

IMAGE

| Part | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Port publishes all change events to Kafka |
| 2 | A Secured Kafka Topic holds all change events |
| 3 | Listener implementation on your side. (Could be anything, i.e. Lambda Function, Docker, etc.) |

## Port example repo (Kafka Listener)

We provide you with a code framework in Node.js to listen to and parse Kafka events.
