# Data manipulation tools

Sometimes you might want to perform common data migration or manipulation steps.

In order to make it easier to manipulate data in common use-cases, we provide a [Github repository](https://github.com/port-labs/script-examples) with some sample scripts

:::note
This repo is `private` at the moment, so youâ€™ll get a 404.
Please contact us with your GitHub user for access.

Some examples of the scripts included in the repository are:

- Sort page order - This script will sort the pages in Port's sidebar according to the ABC
- Change string property to date - This script will fix a property on an entity of date-like strings, and will convert them to actual date strings, for use with the `date-time` format
