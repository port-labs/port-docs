# Platform Overview

## What is Port

Welcome to Port! :wave:

Whether you are a DevEx, platform, or DevOps engineer, Port helps you create your custom Developer Portal in no time! With Port, you can build the perfect setup and workflow for your organizational needs, in order to make your developer's lives much easier with self-service capabilities

![Developer Platform complete vision](../static/img/quickstart/platform-vision.png)

### Port as a Builder

Our approach is to let you build anything with maximum flexibility. Therefore, we took a **builder-based** approach, in which you can build your asset landscape whichever way works for you. We don't enforce anything on how you build your catalog.

### We are API-first

<sup><mark>And it is not just an empty claim.</mark></sup>

We built Port with an **API-First approach**, meaning that our product and API go hand in hand, consequently benefiting our development velocity and our users, too. You can use our API to perform any operation on the Platform, while we provide you with the logic and the detailed documentation.

:::note
We Use the **OpenAPI 3** specification.  
Visit our [Swagger.](https://api.getport.io/static/index.html#/)

## Main points

- **Blueprints** are the main building blocks in Port, they represent software & infrastructure assets.
- **Entities** are objects that match the types defined by Blueprints.
- A **Page** holds all the information you need for a specific Blueprint, Entity, and more.
- There are a few different ways you can ingest data and interact with your data in Port:
  - Via the **UI**.
  - Using our **API**.
  - Using 3rd party app integrations, for example [GitHub App](./api-providers/gitops/), [GitHub Action](./api-providers/github-action.md), [K8s Exporter](./exporters/k8s-exporter/).
- Audit Log, User management, granular permissions, and more are available on the Port platform.

## Blueprints Page

### First, what's a Blueprint?

A **Blueprint** is the _most basic_ building block in Port. It represents assets that can be managed in Port, such as `Microservice`, `Environments`, `Packages`, `Clusters`, `Databases`, and many more.

Blueprints are completely customizable, and they support any number of properties the user chooses, all of which can be modified as you go.

### Our building-space

The Blueprints page is the main system page, in which you can create your full asset layout: create new Blueprints, connect between them, edit or delete them, and set advanced operations on top of every one of them.

When you first log in to Port, you will see an empty Blueprints page, like this one:

![Empty Blueprints Page](../static/img/software-catalog/EmptyBlueprintsPage.png)

### How to create a Blueprint?

There are two ways to create a Blueprint:

- Through the UI
- Using API

:::tip
To create your first blueprint, please see our [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md).

## Navigation bar

On the left sidebar of the platform you can find the main navigation bar.

It is divided into two sections: `Organization` and `Software Catalog`.

The `Organization` section holds the following system pages:

- [Blueprints](#first-whats-a-blueprint)
- [Users](#the-users-page)
- [Audit Log](#the-audit-log)

The `Software Catalog` holds all of the [pages](#main-pages).

## Pages

### How is a port page created?

#### Main Pages

A new page is created whenever a new Blueprint is created. The page will appear on the left side of the navigation bar, and its name will be either the title of the Blueprint, or the identifier name (if the title is not set).

Every Blueprint's page is its main page, showing a full-page table view containing the [Entities](#whats-an-entity) of a specific Blueprint.

![Microservices Main Page](../static/img/software-catalog/MicroservicesMainPage.png)

#### Entity pages

Every [Entity](#whats-an-entity) has its page, showing a summary of the Entity's data and other related entities.

![Entity page](../static/img/software-catalog/EntityPageExample.png)

:::note

#### What's an Entity?

An Entity is the object instance of a Blueprint, and it represents software component data,as defined by the Blueprint properties.

See [Port Components](./software-catalog/) for further details.
:::

### Saved views

Pages can also be created from any main page, by creating saved views:

![Create a saved view page](../static/img/software-catalog/SaveViewAs.gif)

## The Audit Log

In Port, we store every event in a visual log that shows which events took place on different Blueprints and Entities. For example: which Entity was modified, who invoked a Self-Service Action, what is an eventâ€™s status and more.

The page is divided into 2 tabs:

- Entities
- Blueprints
- Runs

![Main Audit Log Page Entities Tab](../static/img/software-catalog/AuditLogPage.png)

## The Users page and the Teams page

Port has pages dedicated for managing all users and teams in the system:

- The Users page shows a list of all users, including their roles and group membership;
- The Teams page shows a list of all teams, including a list of team members for each team.

![Main Users Page](../static/img/software-catalog/UsersPageExample.png)

### Managing Users and Teams

In Port, you can control and manage all your users and teams, in one place. To learn more, refer to the [Users and Teams management](./software-catalog/role-based-access-control/users-and-teams-management.md) page.

## Next steps

The best way to get started with Port is by configuring some initial Blueprints and ingesting data into the platform. To do that, move on to the [Software Catalog](./software-catalog/) page
