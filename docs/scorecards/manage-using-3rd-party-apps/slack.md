# Send Slack messages

Your developer portal contains valuable data about your entities, including their compliance with your standards (using scorecards or initiatives). For example, you can easily determine the production readiness (scorecard) of a microservice (an entity).

The [Port message sender](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/port-sender) allows you to send reports and reminders via Slack to relevant personas, letting managers and developers know what standards need to be met that are relevant to them.

:::tip Gitlab Support
The example on this page uses a Github workflow, to achieve this using Gitlab, see [this](/docs/guides/all/setup-slack-reminders.md?git-provider=gitlab) guide.

Head to the Port sender [Slack section](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/port-sender#slack) to learn more about the integration and how to use it.
