# Examples


### Ownership scorecard

The following example demonstrates an ownership scorecard.

It has one filter defined:

- Only evaluate entities that are related to production (indicated by checking that the `is_production` property is set to `true`).

It has two rules:

- Check that a defined on-call exists and that the number of `open_incidents` is lower than 5.
- Check if a team exists.

### Ensure relation existence

Say we have a `service` blueprint that has a relation to another blueprint named `domain`.  
We can define a scorecard that checks that all of our services have a related domain. Services with empty `domain` relations will fail this check:

### DORA metrics based on number of deployments

To assess the deployment frequency of a `service`, simply checking the `deployment` relation is not enough â€” we need to know the exact number of deployments. To achieve this, we can:

- Add an [aggregation property](/build-your-software-catalog/customize-integrations/configure-data-model/setup-blueprint/properties/aggregation-property.md) to the `service` blueprint that counts the number of related `deployment` entities.
- Add a scorecard with a rule based on the new aggregation property:

## Automation examples

### Send a Slack/Teams message whenever a scorecard rule result is updated

#### Automation definition

By using the `ENTITY_UPDATED` trigger type, we can run custom logic whenever an entity of a specific type is updated.  

The following configuration will cause a message to be sent whenever a scorecard rule result is updated:

<details>
<summary><b>Automation configuration (click to expand)</b></summary>

**Remember to change `github-org-name` and `github-repo-name` to your GitHub organization name and repository in the highlighted lines.**

```json showLineNumbers
{
"identifier": "ruleResultUpdated",
"title": "Rule result updated",
"trigger": {
    "type": "automation",
    "event": {
    "type": "ENTITY_UPDATED",
    "blueprintIdentifier": "_rule_result"
    }
},
"invocationMethod": {
    "type": "GITHUB",
    # highlight-start
    "org": "github-org-name",
    "repo": "github-repo-name",
    # highlight-end
    "workflow": "notify-rule-result-updated.yaml",
    "workflowInputs": {
    "rule_result_name": "{{ .event.context.entityIdentifier }}",
    "entity_link": "{{ .event.diff.after.properties.entity_link }}"
    },
    "reportWorkflowStatus": true
},
"publish": true
}
```
</details>

* `invocationMethod.workflowInputs` is the payload to be passed to the GitHub workflow upon every execution. In this example, we pass the rule result's identifier and the link to the evaluated entity.

* `invocationMethod.reportWorkflowStatus` is set to `true` to automatically update the action run in Port with the status of the GitHub workflow.

#### Backend - GitHub workflow

The `notify-rule-result-updated.yaml` workflow will contain the logic to send a Slack/Teams message.

<h4>Prerequisite - set up webhooks</h4>

The workflow requires a Slack webhook URL and/or a Microsoft Teams webhook URL to send the message.  

Slack:
1. To set up a Slack webhook, follow the instructions [here](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks).
2. Once you have the webhook URL, add it as a secret in your GitHub repository named `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`.

Microsoft Teams:
1. To set up a Microsoft Teams webhook, follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook).
2. Once you have the webhook URL, add it as a secret in your GitHub repository named `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL`.

### Create a GitHub issue whenever a scorecard rule result is degraded

#### Automation definition

By using the `ENTITY_UPDATED` trigger type, we can run custom logic whenever an entity of a specific type is updated.  

The following configuration will create a GitHub issue whenever a scorecard rule result's `Result` property changes from `Passed` to `Not passed`:

    },
    "reportWorkflowStatus": true
  },
  "publish": true
}
```
</details>

* `trigger.condition` checks the rule result's `Result` property before and after the update. The automation will only run for rule results that have been degraded.

* `invocationMethod.workflowInputs` is the payload to be passed to the GitHub workflow upon every execution. In this example, we pass the rule result's identifier and the link to the evaluated entity.

* `invocationMethod.reportWorkflowStatus` is set to `true` to automatically update the action run in Port with the status of the GitHub workflow.
