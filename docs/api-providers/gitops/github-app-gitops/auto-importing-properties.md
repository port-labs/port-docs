# Auto importing properties

### Introduction

With our Github app you can auto import properties from a GitHub repository, like `commitMessage`, `commitedBy`, `mainLanguage`, and much more.

### Auto importable properties

### Using auto importable properties

In order to use auto importable properties, add the JSON below to your [Blueprint schema](../../../software-catalog/blueprint/blueprint.md#blueprints-properties). If you still don't have a Blueprint with GitHub integration, please refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart) section to create one.

:::tip
You can choose to include only a subset of the auto importable properties shown above, or all of them.
