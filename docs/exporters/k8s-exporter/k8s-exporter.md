# K8S Exporter

Our integration with Kubernetes allows you to export Kubernetes objects to Port as Entities of existing Blueprints.

## Kubernetes Exporter benefits

- List and export existing Kubernetes objects in your cluster;
- Watch for Kubernetes object changes (Create/Update/Delete) in real-time and automatically apply the changes to your Entities in Port;
- Configure which Kubernetes objects are relevant, and how to map and transform objects to Port Entities.
