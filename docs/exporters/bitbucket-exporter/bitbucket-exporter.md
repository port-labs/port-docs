# Bitbucket Exporter

Our integration with Bitbucket allows you to export Bitbucket objects to Port as Entities of existing Blueprints.

## What does our Bitbucket Exporter offer you?

- List and export existing Bitbucket objects from your Bitbucket organization;
- Watch for Bitbucket objects changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your Entities in Port;
- Configure which Bitbucket objects are relevant, and how to map and transform objects to Port Entities.

## Next Steps

- [Install Port's Bitbucket Exporter](./installation.md)
- [How to configure the Bitbucket app](./configuration.md)
- [Automatically import `pull-requests` from Bitbucket](./exporting-pull-requests.md)
- [Automatically import `repositories` from Bitbucket](./exporting-repositories.md)
