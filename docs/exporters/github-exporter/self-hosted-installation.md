# Self Hosted Installation

:::note Prerequisites

- A registered organization in Port;
- Your Port user role is set to `Admin`.

:::

In organizations that have a self-hosted GitHub installation there is no access to our official public app, therefore there are some extra steps you need to take for installation:

1. Register Port's GitHub App in your GitHub organization;
2. Deploy Port's GitHub App Docker Image inside your VPC;
3. Install Port's GitHub App in your GitHub organization and on select repositories.

## Registering Port's GitHub App

1. First, navigate to your organization inside your self-hosted GitHub and click on Settings

![Org view](../../../static/img/integrations/github-app/SelfHostedOrganizaionView.png)

2. Inside the settings view, click on Developer Settings -> and then select GitHub Apps

![Settings view](../../../static/img/integrations/github-app/SelfHostedOrganizationSettings.png)

3. Click on "New GitHub App"

4. Now insert all of the following properties:

- GitHub App name: port.io
- Homepage URL: https://getport.io
- Webhook URL: HTTP Server URL, if you don't yet know the value of this step, leave it blank until you deploy the GitHub backend
- Webhook secret: Webhook secret (Any string you would like)
- Repository Permissions:
  - Actions: Readonly
  - Checks: Read and Write (for validating `Port.yml`)
  - Contents: Readonly
  - Metadata: Readonly
  - Issues: Readonly
  - Pull Request: Read and Write
- Repository Events:
  - Issues
  - Pull Request
  - Push
  - Workflow Run

Then select "Create GitHub App"

5. Now go to the settings of the created GitHub App and Generate a private key

And save the downloaded file

## Deployment

:::note Prerequisites

- You will need your Port `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`. To find your Port API credentials go to [Port](https://app.getport.io), click on `Credentials` at the bottom left corner and you will be able to view and copy your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`:

## Docker

To use our GitHub app you will need to deploy our official GitHub app docker image on your VPC.

It can be deployed on any platform that allows deploying images as containers such as: K8S, ECS, AWS App Runner, etc.

You can pull the Docker image by running:

```bash showLineNumbers
docker pull ghcr.io/port-labs/port-self-hosted-github-app:0.2.0
```

And now run it via:

```bash showLineNumbers
docker run -e APP_ID=<APP_ID from register step> -e WEBHOOK_SECRET=<WEBHOOK_SECRET from previous step> -e GHE_HOST=<GITHUB BASE HOST, ie github.compay.com> -e PORT=<Any PORT> -e PORT_URL=https://api.getport.io -e PORT_CLIENT_ID=<Port's CLIENT_ID> -e PORT_CLIENT_SECRET=<Port's CLIENT_SECRET> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<BASE 64 PRIVATEKEY> ghcr.io/port-labs/port-self-hosted-github-app
```

## Health check route

A health check is a route that is used to check the health of a service. It is a means to ensure that the service is running properly and can perform its intended function.

Our GitHub App image previews such routes at `https://host:port/health` for you to be able to monitor its status.

## Installing Port's GitHub application

After you have the App registered in your organization and the docker is up and running, you can install the app and select the repositories to integrate it with

1. First, navigate to your organization inside your self-hosted GitHub and click on Settings

![Org view](../../../static/img/integrations/github-app/SelfHostedOrganizaionView.png)

2. Inside the settings view, click on Developer Settings -> and then select GitHub Apps

![Settings view](../../../static/img/integrations/github-app/SelfHostedOrganizationSettings.png)

3. Click `edit` on the GitHub app created at the step before

![GitHub app installation page](../../../static/img/integrations/github-app/SelfHostedEditGitHubApp.png)

4. Go to Install App -> and select the install button on your wanted organization

5. Choose the repositories you want the app to be installed for.

## Next Steps

Now that you have the GitHub app installed, you can refer to our examples for some practical use cases:

- [Exporting pull requests as entities to Port](./exporting-pull-requests)
- [Exporting repositories files and metadata as entities to Port](./exporting-repositories.md)
- [Exporting entities via port.yml definition file](../../api-providers/gitops/github-app-gitops/quickstart.md)
