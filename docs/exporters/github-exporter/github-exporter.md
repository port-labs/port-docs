# GitHub Exporter

Our integration with GitHub allows you to export GitHub objects to Port as Entities of existing Blueprints.

## What does our GitHub Exporter offer you?

- List and export existing GitHub objects from your GitHub organization;
- Watch for GitHub objects changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your Entities in Port;
- Configure which GitHub objects are relevant, and how to map and transform objects to Port Entities.

## Next Steps

- [Automatically import `pull-requests` from GitHub](./exporting-pull-requests.md)
- [Automatically import `repositories` from GitHub](./exporting-repositories.md)
- [Automatically import `issues` from GitHub](./exporting-issues.md)
- [Automatically import `workflows` from GitHub](./exporting-workflows.md)
- [Automatically import `workflows-runs` from GitHub](./exporting-workflows-runs.md)
