# GitHub Exporter

Our integration with GitHub allows you to export GitHub objects to Port as Entities of existing Blueprints.

## What does our GitHub Exporter offer you?

- List and export existing GitHub objects in your cluster;
- Watch for GitHub objects changes (create/update/delete) in real-time, and automatically apply the changes to your Entities in Port;
- Configure which GitHub objects are relevant, and how to map and transform objects to Port Entities.
